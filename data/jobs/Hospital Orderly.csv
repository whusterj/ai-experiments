<p><i>Trellis is committed to active Reconciliation in alignment with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) 94 calls to action and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). Reconciliation is a highly valued and integrated part of our culture and work. Trellis' Reconciliation journey is intentional with meaningful engagement from all team members both collectively and as individuals.</i></p>
<p><b> Are you someone who is passionate about making a difference in the lives of children, youth and families? Are you a supportive, open-minded and calm human service professional? Would you enjoy collaborating with a multi-disciplinary team? Then trellis is the place for you!</b></p>
<p> Trellis is a Calgary-based social services agency that grew from the amalgamation of Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Calgary and Aspen Family &amp; Community Network Society on June 15, 2020. Growing from a combined history of 117 years, trellis is building on the work of both legacy organizations to offer a continuum of 33 programs for over 9,000 people each year designed to support children, youth, adults, families and communities. The programs and services offered open a path upward for people from all sorts of backgrounds, including those caught at the intersection of society's most complex needs.</p>
<p> Trellis works to end youth, adult and family homelessness and creates space for belonging and exploration in our community. We provide education and employment connections and support safe home environments for everyone we serve, including youth and children whether that be in their own home or through foster care or group care. We support deeper connections by meeting people where they are, across all cultures, languages and diversity spectrums.

We believe that it is important for youth to continue learning this and equally important that we role model it.
