Currently, more than 15,000 credit students choose from 13 bachelor degrees and 38 majors.</p><p>Mount Royal University is located in the traditional territories of the Niitsitapi (Blackfoot) and the people of the Treaty 7 region in southern Alberta, which includes the Siksika, the Piikani, the Kainai, the Tsuut'ina and the Iyarhe Nakoda.

Elle est depuis devenue une firme d'envergure mondiale qui compte maintenant 120 bureaux dans 20 pays. Certes, notre croissance a été rapide, mais ce qui compte le plus, c’est la conviction commune qui pousse nos 5 000 employés à faire de notre firme une société immobilière différente. Nous sommes d'avis que les lieux de vie, de travail et de loisir ont le pouvoir de nous rendre plus heureux et en meilleure santé, et nous sommes unis par un but commun : avoir un impact positif sur la vie des gens. Bref, nous sommes une société immobilière commerciale mondiale avec un objectif simple: que l’immobilier joue un rôle de premier plan dans la création d'espaces, de villes et de lieux dynamiques offrant une valeur sociale et un impact économique durables.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Pourquoi travailler ici?</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Notre industrie est en changement constant et nous voulons que notre entreprise soit un lieu où se rencontrent des esprits curieux, des cœurs passionnés et des idées stratégiques. Chez Avison Young, nous nous engageons à embaucher des personnes de tous les horizons axés sur la collaboration et l'innovation. Nous croyons qu'une main-d'œuvre diversifiée et généreuse crée une entreprise plus forte, plus compétente et plus compétitive. Nous vous offrons un endroit où vous pourrez vous améliorer et changer les choses. La collaboration est ancrée dans notre façon de travailler: nos employés ont l’autonomie nécessaire pour collaborer aux relations avec les clients, engager des équipes dans l’ensemble de l’entreprise, diriger les opérations, travailler collectivement à des projets, participer à la stratégie de l'entreprise et ultimement, être à la barre de notre croissance. Notre modèle de gestion distinctif, selon lequel nos associés dirigent notre firme, nous place dans la position enviable de pouvoir offrir à chaque employé la possibilité de détenir une part de notre entreprise. Ce modèle inspire et permet à quiconque de devenir un Associé d'Avison Young. Ce rôle confère aux employés le droit de vote afin qu'ils aient vraiment leur mot à dire sur l’orientation future et le fonctionnement de notre entreprise. Cela signifie que nous sommes en mesure d'attirer, d'engager et de fidéliser les meilleurs talents.</p><p> </p><p>______________</p><p> </p><p>Our small Canadian-born business was founded in 1978 and has become a global organisation that now spans 120 locations across 20 countries. Our expansion has been rapid, but what matters most is the common belief that drives all 5,000 of our people to be a different type of real estate organisation. We believe that the places in which we live, work and play have the power to make us happier and healthier, and we are united by a shared sense of purpose, to have a positive impact on people’s lives. In short, we are a global commercial real estate advisory firm with a simple aim: for real estate to play a leading role in creating vibrant buildings, cities and places that deliver long-lasting social value and economic impact.  </p><p> </p><p><strong>Why Work for Us:</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>We believe that our industry is changing, and we want our business to be a melting pot of curious minds, passionate hearts and strategic intelligence. Your gender, religion and race are all highly respected, but are less important to us than your ability to step up and change the game. We provide you with a place where you can do just that, with like-minded people. Collaboration is embedded in the way we work – our people have the autonomy to collaborate on client relationships, engage teams across the business, lead operations, work collectively on projects, participate in strategy and are ultimately responsible for our growth. Our distinctive Principal-led, privately-owned model puts us in the enviable position of being able to offer every employee the opportunity to own a share of our business, and inspires and allows anyone to become a Principal. This role carries voting rights so our people have a very real say in the future direction and operation of our business.
