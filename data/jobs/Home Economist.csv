Together, we share this land, strive to live together, learn together, walk together, and grow together ""in a good way.""<br/> <br/> In the spring of 2016, UCalgary set out to build the Indigenous Strategy (ii'taa'poh'to'p) by gathering stories and perspectives from Traditional Knowledge Keepers, cultural advisors, agencies, and communities. The strategy was adopted in November 2017 with a foundation in transformation, renewal, and shared ethical space. It includes 27 recommendations that address ways of knowing, doing, connecting and being, touching on all aspects of the university. The university is enacting the strategy's directions through an Elders/UCalgary leadership Circle of Advisors, the UCalgary Indigenous Strategy Implementation Committee and its seven sub-committees, and the ii' taa'poh'to'p Student Circle of Advisors, as well as several other faculty-based committees and action plans.<br/> <br/> Ii'taa'poh'to'p guides UCalgary on its path of transformation and communicates its commitment and responsibility for truth and reconciliation. The strategy is and will remain a living document within the institution, whereby progress will be monitored, and content and direction will be renewed through a process of evaluation and evolution. https://www.ucalgary.ca/indigenous/ii-taapohtop <br/> <br/> The diversity of our scholars and staff are reflective of UCalgary's commitment to ensure that all have a rightful place to learn and to grow. Our values underpin this commitment, through our teaching, research and community outreach, to serve individuals and communities to flourish and thrive.</p>

For more information on all research themes, please see in the following site: https://research.ucalgary.ca/cerc <br/> <br/> <b>University of Calgary CERC Theme - Pluralistic Societies: Transdisciplinarity, Cognitive Justice and Education</b><br/> Globally, and locally, we are witnessing societies shaped by increasing human entanglements and social polarization. Pluralism in the city, what might be called pluralism from below, recognizes the need for an active engagement that creates a society of shared values, and peace and prosperity from a diversity of civilizations, cultures, peoples, groups, and entities. It addresses the wicked social challenges associated with super-diversity and hyper-diversity of our time: social disconnection, division, distrust, dehumanization, religious intolerance and political strife. Pluralism is inextricably concerned with depolarisation. It is fundamentally concerned with how to make diversity work so that we can live well together. It requires actively cultivating an understanding of different perspectives and facilitating how this multiplicity shapes social transformation for the better. Pluralism is what can emerge from relationship building and intercultural engagement, bridging divides, social healing, collaborative problem solving, and interfaith engagement. This context calls for a paradigm shift, for bold solutions, culture change, shifting values, norms, skills, behaviours, how we see ourselves and others, and how we see ourselves in relation to diverse others. The University of Calgary has been laying the groundwork toward a Pluralism Strategy for many years and is currently seeking to recruit a global leader in Transdisciplinarity, Cognitive Justice and Education. </p>
<ul>
<li>The chair will advance the intersection of transdisciplinarity, cognitive justice and education. It will develop a policy-relevant research agenda to foster transformation in the higher education sector, with the aim of creating a more inclusive education and societies that can confront the challenges of polarization facing human societies.</li>
<li>The chair will advance transdisciplinarity, cognitive justice and education as an integral methodology for a reformulated epistemology that is necessary to support emerging local, national and global policy frameworks, and advance and protect plural knowledges and intellectual property rights.</li>
<li>It will develop and advance terms and conditions for plural knowledges, and the integration of different forms of knowledge in higher education.</li>
<li>It will foster transdisciplinary scholarship for systems transformation including in education, law, economics and science.</li>

The CERC program stands at the centre of a national strategy to foster research excellence in Canada and improve our depth of knowledge and quality of life, strengthen Canada's international competitiveness, and help train the next generation of highly skilled people. The program offers an avenue for Canadian institutions to recruit the best global talent and brand Canada as a location of choice for world-leading research. CERCs are one of the largest and most prestigious awards available globally, providing the world's top researchers and their teams with funding support over eight years to support their research programs and teams.<br/> <br/> The CERC recruitment uses a two staged process where interested applicants must first apply to the open job posting at the University. The successful applicant from that first stage will then enter a second stage, for which they co-develop an application with the University to the federal government funding program. The University of Calgary will provide substantial institutional support in the preparation and development of the program application. Appointment to one of these positions is contingent upon the applicant being awarded a Canada Excellence Research Chair and is subject to the availability of funding and to final approval by the University Board of Governors and the Tri-agency Institutional Programs Secretariat (TIPS). Interested applicants are invited to review the full program details: https://www.cerc.gc.ca/program-programme/cpan-pccs-eng.aspx#2. Candidates who are unsuccessful in a CERC chair application at the national competition may be considered as a nominee for a Canada Research Chair (Tier I) in the areas identified below. <br/> <br/> CERC Chair awardees will have up to 12 months to take up the award after the notice of award and acceptance has been signed by all parties.<br/> <br/> This program provides an opportunity for international researchers, including Canadian expatriates wishing to relocate to Canada, to lead a prestigious research program at the University of Calgary and to contribute to Canada's excellence in research and innovation. Applicants must be full professors or associate professors expected to be promoted to full professor within one to two years of the nomination. Successful applicants will have an outstanding track record of research contributions in their field including a commitment to equity, diversity and inclusion within their research ecosystems, and demonstrated leadership/mentorship within research teams. The University of Calgary is seeking CERC candidates in six areas of strategic focus. For more information on all research themes, please see in the following site: https://research.ucalgary.ca/cerc <br/> <br/> <b>University of Calgary CERC Theme - Intersection of Stress and Addiction</b> <br/> Addiction is a mental illness that knows no socio-economic, geographic, cultural, gender, or age boundaries. Morbidity and mortality associated with addiction have emerged as a public health crisis in Canada. Individuals who are subjected to stressors such as pain and/or inflammation, trauma, poverty, homelessness, adverse childhood experiences, mental illness, and loneliness are more likely to develop addiction. Additionally, the changes in brain circuits or behavior that occur following stress may favour compulsive substance use. Stress also plays a key role during drug withdrawal and life stressors are a key driver for resumption of drug use (relapse). Although there has been widespread interest in understanding how stress increases the likelihood of addiction and contributes to relapse, the underlying neurobiology remains unknown. Reducing the adverse impact of addiction must consider how environmental stressors and other socioeconomic determinants of health affect drug and alcohol consumption, and devise strategies to reduce the impact of these risk factors. The University of Calgary has developed a strong base in stress research and supports a rapidly growing addiction research group. The chair in the Intersection of Stress and Addiction will catalyze this expertise to address the burden of drug and alcohol addiction in Canada.<br/> <br/> <b>To Apply</b><br/> <i>The University of Calgary's comprehensive benefits and pension program is designed to promote a productive level of health and well-being to staff members.

<p><b>Position Description</b> </p>
<p>The University of Calgary (UCalgary), located in the heart of Southern Alberta, both acknowledges and pays tribute to the traditional territories of the peoples of Treaty 7, which include the Blackfoot Confederacy (comprised of the Siksika, the Piikani, and the Kainai First Nations) as well as the Tsuut'ina First Nation, and the Stoney Nakoda (including Chiniki, Bearspaw, and Wesley First Nations). The university recognizes that the City of Calgary is also home to Region III of the Métis Nation of Alberta. By virtue of the signing of Treaty 7 in 1877, the university recognizes that we are all treaty people. The City of Calgary is home to a culturally diverse community. Together, we share this land, strive to live together, learn together, walk together, and grow together ""in a good way.""<br/> <br/> In the spring of 2016, UCalgary set out to build the Indigenous Strategy (ii'taa'poh'to'p) by gathering stories and perspectives from Traditional Knowledge Keepers, cultural advisors, agencies, and communities. The strategy was adopted in November 2017 with a foundation in transformation, renewal, and shared ethical space. It includes 27 recommendations that address ways of knowing, doing, connecting and being, touching on all aspects of the university. The university is enacting the strategy's directions through an Elders/UCalgary leadership Circle of Advisors, the UCalgary Indigenous Strategy Implementation Committee and its seven sub-committees, and the ii' taa'poh'to'p Student Circle of Advisors, as well as several other faculty-based committees and action plans.<br/> <br/> Ii'taa'poh'to'p guides UCalgary on its path of transformation and communicates its commitment and responsibility for truth and reconciliation. The strategy is and will remain a living document within the institution, whereby progress will be monitored, and content and direction will be renewed through a process of evaluation and evolution. https://www.ucalgary.ca/indigenous/ii-taapohtop <br/> <br/> The diversity of our scholars and staff are reflective of UCalgary's commitment to ensure that all have a rightful place to learn and to grow. Our values underpin this commitment, through our teaching, research and community outreach, to serve individuals and communities to flourish and thrive.</p>
<p> The University of Calgary is committed to Indigenous Engagement and systemic change and is seeking candidates for a <b>Tier 2 Canada Research Chair (CRC) in the area of Weaving Indigenous Science and Sustainability Science </b>in the Faculty of Science. The successful candidate for the CRC will be appointed at the rank of Assistant Professor (tenure-track) or Associate Professor (with tenure). This recruitment will be complimented by additional appointments that will support continued Indigenization within the Faculty of Science, notably an Assistant Professor or Instructor in the area of Indigenous Science.<br/> <br/> <b>Canadian Research Chair</b><br/> <br/> The Canada Research Chairs Program stands at the centre of a national strategy to make Canada one of the world's top countries in research and development. It invests approximately $295 million per year to attract and retain a diverse cadre of world-class researchers, to reinforce academic research and training excellence in Canadian postsecondary institutions. Tier 2 Chairs are tenable for five years and renewable once. Tier 2 Chairs are intended for exceptional emerging scholars (i.e., candidates must have been an active researcher in their field for fewer than 10 years at the time of nomination). Candidates who are more than 10 years from having earned their highest degree and who have had career breaks, such as maternity, parental, or extended sick leave, clinical training, and research interruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic etc., may have their eligibility for a Tier 2 Chair assessed through the program's Tier 2 justification process. Please contact UCalgary's Office of Research Services for more information: ipd@ucalgary.ca. Further information about the Canada Research Chairs Program can be found on the Government of Canada's CRC website, including eligibility criteria: https://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.aspx <br/> <br/> Applicants will have earned a PhD in a Science discipline with an area of specialization related to environmental impacts, remediation and/or sustainability. This CRC is a unique opportunity for innovative research weaving Indigenous and Western approaches, while fostering self-determination with regard to the research program.<br/> <br/> The Chair will establish an active research program that focuses on environmental impacts, remediation and sustainability of lands or water affected by resource extraction (e.g. mining, oilsands, pipelines), and aligns with ii'taa'poh'to'p and the University of Calgary's and the Faculty of Science strategic plans. Regardless of the Western focus, the Chair would combine their efforts with protocols inclusive of Indigenous ways of knowing and Indigenous communities. Namely, one or more of: community-based participatory research, interviews and other involvement of Elders and Knowledge Keepers, and ethnography. Remediation is complex, and meaningful progress requires combining Western reductionist approaches with honouring and incorporating the deep knowledge held by Indigenous peoples. The Chair will play an important role in teaching and research supervision of undergraduate and graduate students in one of the six departments in the Faculty of Science, based on their area of expertise. Service to the department, faculty, University, and community is also expected. The successful candidate ideally will have work/research experience in an Indigenous community.<br/> <br/> The Chair will have the opportunity to be part of a prolific and diverse research environment in the Faculty of Science, with access to state-of-the-art core infrastructure.

<p><b>Position Description</b> </p>
<p>The University of Calgary invites applications from world-leading researchers for the prestigious Canada Excellence Research Chairs (CERC) Competition. The CERC program is designed to attract world-renowned researchers to launch ambitious and impactful research programs at Canadian universities. <br/> <br/> Located in Canada's most enterprising city, the traditional territory of the peoples of Treaty 7 and Region 3 of the Métis Nation of Alberta, the University of Calgary (UCalgary) is a global and innovative intellectual hub for teaching and learning, research and scholarship, and community engagement.<br/> <br/> UCalgary is one of Canada's top comprehensive research universities, with more than 6,500 graduate students and 28,500 undergraduate students, more than 1,800 academic staff (continuing, contingent term or limited term appointment), more than 1,300 sessionals, and more than 3,200 non-academic staff, in 14 Faculties, across five campuses. The vibrant and research-intensive environment at UCalgary is home to 146 research chairs (with 99 Canada Research Chair allocations), and more than 50 research institutes and centres. UCalgary has the fastest growth rate in attracting research funding among the 10 largest universities in Canada and in 2022 ranked fifth among Canada's top research universities in Re$earch Infosource Inc.'s latest Top 50 Research Universities, the youngest university to have reached the top five.<br/> <br/> The university's new Framework for Growth establishes principles and focus areas for the University of Calgary over the coming decade. It will ignite our entrepreneurial spirit to turn challenges into opportunities to improve the world around us. It will help to meet our academic and research ambitions and strengthen our community engagement in one of Canada's most diverse cities, whose exciting future is unfolding rapidly, and where scientific disciplines will play a major role. Built around three big ideas (transdisciplinary scholarship, integration with our community and future-focused program delivery), the Framework will distinguish the university and drive growth.<br/> <br/> To learn more about this vision please see: https://www.ucalgary.ca/president/growth <br/> <br/> <b>The Opportunity</b><br/> The University of Calgary invites applications from world renowned researchers for the prestigious Canada Excellence Research Chairs (CERC) 2022 Competition. The CERC program stands at the centre of a national strategy to foster research excellence in Canada and improve our depth of knowledge and quality of life, strengthen Canada's international competitiveness, and help train the next generation of highly skilled people. The program offers an avenue for Canadian institutions to recruit the best global talent and brand Canada as a location of choice for world-leading research. CERCs are one of the largest and most prestigious awards available globally, providing the world's top researchers and their teams with funding support over eight years to support their research programs and teams.<br/> <br/> The CERC recruitment uses a two staged process where interested applicants must first apply to the open job posting at the University. The successful applicant from that first stage will then enter a second stage, for which they co-develop an application with the University to the federal government funding program. The University of Calgary will provide substantial institutional support in the preparation and development of the program application. Appointment to one of these positions is contingent upon the applicant being awarded a Canada Excellence Research Chair and is subject to the availability of funding and to final approval by the University Board of Governors and the Tri-agency Institutional Programs Secretariat (TIPS). Interested applicants are invited to review the full program details: https://www.cerc.gc.ca/program-programme/cpan-pccs-eng.aspx#2. Candidates who are unsuccessful in a CERC chair application at the national competition may be considered as a nominee for a Canada Research Chair (Tier I) in the areas identified below. <br/> <br/> CERC Chair awardees will have up to 12 months to take up the award after the notice of award and acceptance has been signed by all parties.<br/> <br/> This program provides an opportunity for international researchers, including Canadian expatriates wishing to relocate to Canada, to lead a prestigious research program at the University of Calgary and to contribute to Canada's excellence in research and innovation. Applicants must be full professors or associate professors expected to be promoted to full professor within one to two years of the nomination. Successful applicants will have an outstanding track record of research contributions in their field including a commitment to equity, diversity and inclusion within their research ecosystems, and demonstrated leadership/mentorship within research teams. The University of Calgary is seeking CERC candidates in six areas of strategic focus. For more information on all research themes, please see in the following site: https://research.ucalgary.ca/cerc <br/> <br/> <b>University of Calgary CERC Theme - Hydrogen - Safe, Acceptable and Fair Energy</b><br/> All communities need access to safe, clean, and reliable energy. Hydrogen is one option, but its execution remains a major uncertainty. The proposed CERC program in Hydrogen - Safe Acceptable and Fair Energy (H2-SAFE) will create and/or enable safe paths to clean, economic hydrogen-based energy. In collaboration with an inclusive and dynamic ecosystem of researchers, the CERC will research and develop solutions for safe practical application and acceleration of clean hydrogen in communities. To ensure transdisciplinary approaches are integral to the research program, the Chairholder will be cross-appointed between a non-STEM department and the Schulich School of Engineering. Expected research topics will include: 1) safe engagement to accelerate hydrogen solutions; ii) safe materials (storage, transport); iii) safe hydrogen generation (to the environment, sustainable and beneficial); iv) actions to accelerate acceptable deployment; v) outreach to engage communities. In collaboration with academic, industry and community partners, the CERC program will be focused on both social and technical solutions for accelerated adoption of hydrogen generation and end use.<br/> <br/> <b>To Apply</b><br/> <i>The University of Calgary's comprehensive benefits and pension program is designed to promote a productive level of health and well-being to staff members.

Considered as critical bellwethers of climate change, these regions are experiencing disproportionate warming at twice the global average. The successful CERC candidate will lead the integration of hydrologic, meteorological and hydro-ecological research activities within next-generation numerical environmental prediction systems. The research will use an integrated, risk-based solutions framework to facilitate sound water resource and ecosystem management within a One Health approach. Advancing solutions to water-related UN Sustainable Development Goals requires transdisciplinary research programs that consider social, political and community partnerships. The CERC program is expected to develop novel climate adaptation strategies/mitigation approaches and implementation models that involves the co-development and implementation of ethical-based approaches, including the braiding of both western and Indigenous knowledge-based systems. Validation should be achieved through community-led efforts co-developed with Indigenous knowledge holders to derive solutions optimized for local, regional and global settings.<br/> <br/> <b>To Apply</b><br/> <i>The University of Calgary's comprehensive benefits and pension program is designed to promote a productive level of health and well-being to staff members.

</p><p>The University of Calgary (UCalgary), located in the heart of Southern Alberta, both acknowledges and pays tribute to the traditional territories of the peoples of Treaty 7, which include the Blackfoot Confederacy (comprised of the Siksika, the Piikani, and the Kainai First Nations) as well as the Tsuut'ina First Nation, and the Stoney Nakoda (including Chiniki, Bearspaw, and Wesley First Nations). The university recognizes that the City of Calgary is also home to Region III of the Métis Nation of Alberta. By virtue of the signing of Treaty 7 in 1877, the university recognizes that we are all treaty people. The City of Calgary is home to a culturally diverse community. Together, we share this land, strive to live together, learn together, walk together, and grow together ""in a good way.""<br/>
<br/>
In the spring of 2016, UCalgary set out to build the Indigenous Strategy (ii'taa'poh'to'p) by gathering stories and perspectives from Traditional Knowledge Keepers, cultural advisors, agencies, and communities. The strategy was adopted in November 2017 with a foundation in transformation, renewal, and shared ethical space. It includes 27 recommendations that address ways of knowing, doing, connecting and being, touching on all aspects of the university. The university is enacting the strategy's directions through an Elders/UCalgary leadership Circle of Advisors, the UCalgary Indigenous Strategy Implementation Committee and its seven sub-committees, and the ii' taa'poh'to'p Student Circle of Advisors, as well as several other faculty-based committees and action plans.<br/>
<br/>
Ii'taa'poh'to'p guides UCalgary on its path of transformation and communicates its commitment and responsibility for truth and reconciliation. The strategy is and will remain a living document within the institution, whereby progress will be monitored, and content and direction will be renewed through a process of evaluation and evolution. https://www.ucalgary.ca/indigenous/ii-taapohtop

<br/>
<br/>
<b>University of Calgary CERC Theme - Pluralistic Societies: Transdisciplinarity, Cognitive Justice and Education</b><br/>
Globally, and locally, we are witnessing societies shaped by increasing human entanglements and social polarization. Pluralism in the city, what might be called pluralism from below, recognizes the need for an active engagement that creates a society of shared values, and peace and prosperity from a diversity of civilizations, cultures, peoples, groups, and entities. It addresses the wicked social challenges associated with super-diversity and hyper-diversity of our time: social disconnection, division, distrust, dehumanization, religious intolerance and political strife. Pluralism is inextricably concerned with depolarisation. It is fundamentally concerned with how to make diversity work so that we can live well together. It requires actively cultivating an understanding of different perspectives and facilitating how this multiplicity shapes social transformation for the better. Pluralism is what can emerge from relationship building and intercultural engagement, bridging divides, social healing, collaborative problem solving, and interfaith engagement. This context calls for a paradigm shift, for bold solutions, culture change, shifting values, norms, skills, behaviours, how we see ourselves and others, and how we see ourselves in relation to diverse others. The University of Calgary has been laying the groundwork toward a Pluralism Strategy for many years and is currently seeking to recruit a global leader in Transdisciplinarity, Cognitive Justice and Education.
</p><ul><li>The chair will advance the intersection of transdisciplinarity, cognitive justice and education. It will develop a policy-relevant research agenda to foster transformation in the higher education sector, with the aim of creating a more inclusive education and societies that can confront the challenges of polarization facing human societies.</li>
<li>The chair will advance transdisciplinarity, cognitive justice and education as an integral methodology for a reformulated epistemology that is necessary to support emerging local, national and global policy frameworks, and advance and protect plural knowledges and intellectual property rights.</li>
<li>It will develop and advance terms and conditions for plural knowledges, and the integration of different forms of knowledge in higher education.</li>
<li>It will foster transdisciplinary scholarship for systems transformation including in education, law, economics and science.</li></ul><p><b>

<br/>
<b>University of Calgary CERC Theme - Intersection of Stress and Addiction</b>
<br/>
Addiction is a mental illness that knows no socio-economic, geographic, cultural, gender, or age boundaries. Morbidity and mortality associated with addiction have emerged as a public health crisis in Canada. Individuals who are subjected to stressors such as pain and/or inflammation, trauma, poverty, homelessness, adverse childhood experiences, mental illness, and loneliness are more likely to develop addiction. Additionally, the changes in brain circuits or behavior that occur following stress may favour compulsive substance use. Stress also plays a key role during drug withdrawal and life stressors are a key driver for resumption of drug use (relapse). Although there has been widespread interest in understanding how stress increases the likelihood of addiction and contributes to relapse, the underlying neurobiology remains unknown. Reducing the adverse impact of addiction must consider how environmental stressors and other socioeconomic determinants of health affect drug and alcohol consumption, and devise strategies to reduce the impact of these risk factors. The University of Calgary has developed a strong base in stress research and supports a rapidly growing addiction research group. The chair in the Intersection of Stress and Addiction will catalyze this expertise to address the burden of drug and alcohol addiction in Canada.<br/>

</p><p>The University of Calgary (UCalgary), located in the heart of Southern Alberta, both acknowledges and pays tribute to the traditional territories of the peoples of Treaty 7, which include the Blackfoot Confederacy (comprised of the Siksika, the Piikani, and the Kainai First Nations) as well as the Tsuut'ina First Nation, and the Stoney Nakoda (including Chiniki, Bearspaw, and Wesley First Nations). The university recognizes that the City of Calgary is also home to Region III of the Métis Nation of Alberta. By virtue of the signing of Treaty 7 in 1877, the university recognizes that we are all treaty people. The City of Calgary is home to a culturally diverse community. Together, we share this land, strive to live together, learn together, walk together, and grow together ""in a good way.""<br/>
<br/>
In the spring of 2016, UCalgary set out to build the Indigenous Strategy (ii'taa'poh'to'p) by gathering stories and perspectives from Traditional Knowledge Keepers, cultural advisors, agencies, and communities. The strategy was adopted in November 2017 with a foundation in transformation, renewal, and shared ethical space. It includes 27 recommendations that address ways of knowing, doing, connecting and being, touching on all aspects of the university. The university is enacting the strategy's directions through an Elders/UCalgary leadership Circle of Advisors, the UCalgary Indigenous Strategy Implementation Committee and its seven sub-committees, and the ii' taa'poh'to'p Student Circle of Advisors, as well as several other faculty-based committees and action plans.<br/>
<br/>
Ii'taa'poh'to'p guides UCalgary on its path of transformation and communicates its commitment and responsibility for truth and reconciliation. The strategy is and will remain a living document within the institution, whereby progress will be monitored, and content and direction will be renewed through a process of evaluation and evolution. https://www.ucalgary.ca/indigenous/ii-taapohtop
<br/>
<br/>
The diversity of our scholars and staff are reflective of UCalgary's commitment to ensure that all have a rightful place to learn and to grow. Our values underpin this commitment, through our teaching, research and community outreach, to serve individuals and communities to flourish and thrive.</p><p>
The University of Calgary is committed to Indigenous Engagement and systemic change and is seeking candidates for a <b>Tier 2 Canada Research Chair (CRC) in the area of Weaving Indigenous Science and Sustainability Science </b>in the Faculty of Science. The successful candidate for the CRC will be appointed at the rank of Assistant Professor (tenure-track) or Associate Professor (with tenure). This recruitment will be complimented by additional appointments that will support continued Indigenization within the Faculty of Science, notably an Assistant Professor or Instructor in the area of Indigenous Science.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Canadian Research Chair</b><br/>
<br/>
The Canada Research Chairs Program stands at the centre of a national strategy to make Canada one of the world's top countries in research and development. It invests approximately $295 million per year to attract and retain a diverse cadre of world-class researchers, to reinforce academic research and training excellence in Canadian postsecondary institutions. Tier 2 Chairs are tenable for five years and renewable once. Tier 2 Chairs are intended for exceptional emerging scholars (i.e., candidates must have been an active researcher in their field for fewer than 10 years at the time of nomination). Candidates who are more than 10 years from having earned their highest degree and who have had career breaks, such as maternity, parental, or extended sick leave, clinical training, and research interruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic etc., may have their eligibility for a Tier 2 Chair assessed through the program's Tier 2 justification process. Please contact UCalgary's Office of Research Services for more information: ipd@ucalgary.ca. Further information about the Canada Research Chairs Program can be found on the Government of Canada's CRC website, including eligibility criteria: https://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.aspx
<br/>
<br/>
Applicants will have earned a PhD in a Science discipline with an area of specialization related to environmental impacts, remediation and/or sustainability. This CRC is a unique opportunity for innovative research weaving Indigenous and Western approaches, while fostering self-determination with regard to the research program.<br/>
<br/>
The Chair will establish an active research program that focuses on environmental impacts, remediation and sustainability of lands or water affected by resource extraction (e.g. mining, oilsands, pipelines), and aligns with ii'taa'poh'to'p and the University of Calgary's and the Faculty of Science strategic plans. Regardless of the Western focus, the Chair would combine their efforts with protocols inclusive of Indigenous ways of knowing and Indigenous communities. Namely, one or more of: community-based participatory research, interviews and other involvement of Elders and Knowledge Keepers, and ethnography. Remediation is complex, and meaningful progress requires combining Western reductionist approaches with honouring and incorporating the deep knowledge held by Indigenous peoples. The Chair will play an important role in teaching and research supervision of undergraduate and graduate students in one of the six departments in the Faculty of Science, based on their area of expertise. Service to the department, faculty, University, and community is also expected. The successful candidate ideally will have work/research experience in an Indigenous community.<br/>
<br/>
The Chair will have the opportunity to be part of a prolific and diverse research environment in the Faculty of Science, with access to state-of-the-art core infrastructure. Outstanding opportunities for collaboration are available to advance research within the research themes outlined in the 2018-2023 University Research Plan including Human Dynamics in a Changing World, Energy Innovations for Today and Tomorrow, as well as, focus areas of the One Health Initiative, including the Healthy Water Ecosystems and Healthy Communities. They will contribute to the Faculty of Science's Strategic Plan through the Grand Challenge of Understanding Earth's Evolving Systems and will engage with the University's new Growth Through Focus initiative by developing deeper community partnerships and building transdisciplinary scholarship in one of the areas of focus (Cities and Communities; Democracy and Social Change; Digital Worlds; Energy Transformation; Health and Life).<br/>
<br/>
The successful candidate at the <b>Assistant Professor</b> level must demonstrate evidence of a track record of publications in high quality journals, securing external research funding, and effectiveness in teaching at the University level. The successful candidate at the <b>Associate Professor</b> level must demonstrate evidence of a strong track record of publications in high quality journals, evidence of securing ongoing external research funding, effectiveness in teaching at the University level, and evidence of effective graduate student supervision.<br/>

</p><p>The University of Calgary (UCalgary), located in the heart of Southern Alberta, both acknowledges and pays tribute to the traditional territories of the peoples of Treaty 7, which include the Blackfoot Confederacy (comprised of the Siksika, the Piikani, and the Kainai First Nations) as well as the Tsuut'ina First Nation, and the Stoney Nakoda (including Chiniki, Bearspaw, and Wesley First Nations). The university recognizes that the City of Calgary is also home to Region III of the Métis Nation of Alberta. By virtue of the signing of Treaty 7 in 1877, the university recognizes that we are all treaty people. The City of Calgary is home to a culturally diverse community. Together, we share this land, strive to live together, learn together, walk together, and grow together ""in a good way.""<br/>
<br/>
In the spring of 2016, UCalgary set out to build the Indigenous Strategy (ii'taa'poh'to'p) by gathering stories and perspectives from Traditional Knowledge Keepers, cultural advisors, agencies, and communities. The strategy was adopted in November 2017 with a foundation in transformation, renewal, and shared ethical space. It includes 27 recommendations that address ways of knowing, doing, connecting and being, touching on all aspects of the university. The university is enacting the strategy's directions through an Elders/UCalgary leadership Circle of Advisors, the UCalgary Indigenous Strategy Implementation Committee and its seven sub-committees, and the ii' taa'poh'to'p Student Circle of Advisors, as well as several other faculty-based committees and action plans.<br/>
<br/>
Ii'taa'poh'to'p guides UCalgary on its path of transformation and communicates its commitment and responsibility for truth and reconciliation. The strategy is and will remain a living document within the institution, whereby progress will be monitored, and content and direction will be renewed through a process of evaluation and evolution. https://www.ucalgary.ca/indigenous/ii-taapohtop
<br/>
<br/>
The diversity of our scholars and staff are reflective of UCalgary's commitment to ensure that all have a rightful place to learn and to grow. Our values underpin this commitment, through our teaching, research and community outreach, to serve individuals and communities to flourish and thrive.</p><p>

<br/>
<br/>
<b>University of Calgary CERC Theme - Pluralistic Societies: Transdisciplinarity, Cognitive Justice and Education</b><br/>
Globally, and locally, we are witnessing societies shaped by increasing human entanglements and social polarization. Pluralism in the city, what might be called pluralism from below, recognizes the need for an active engagement that creates a society of shared values, and peace and prosperity from a diversity of civilizations, cultures, peoples, groups, and entities. It addresses the wicked social challenges associated with super-diversity and hyper-diversity of our time: social disconnection, division, distrust, dehumanization, religious intolerance and political strife. Pluralism is inextricably concerned with depolarisation. It is fundamentally concerned with how to make diversity work so that we can live well together. It requires actively cultivating an understanding of different perspectives and facilitating how this multiplicity shapes social transformation for the better. Pluralism is what can emerge from relationship building and intercultural engagement, bridging divides, social healing, collaborative problem solving, and interfaith engagement. This context calls for a paradigm shift, for bold solutions, culture change, shifting values, norms, skills, behaviours, how we see ourselves and others, and how we see ourselves in relation to diverse others. The University of Calgary has been laying the groundwork toward a Pluralism Strategy for many years and is currently seeking to recruit a global leader in Transdisciplinarity, Cognitive Justice and Education.
</p><ul><li>The chair will advance the intersection of transdisciplinarity, cognitive justice and education. It will develop a policy-relevant research agenda to foster transformation in the higher education sector, with the aim of creating a more inclusive education and societies that can confront the challenges of polarization facing human societies.</li>
<li>The chair will advance transdisciplinarity, cognitive justice and education as an integral methodology for a reformulated epistemology that is necessary to support emerging local, national and global policy frameworks, and advance and protect plural knowledges and intellectual property rights.</li>
<li>It will develop and advance terms and conditions for plural knowledges, and the integration of different forms of knowledge in higher education.</li>

The program offers an avenue for Canadian institutions to recruit the best global talent and brand Canada as a location of choice for world-leading research. CERCs are one of the largest and most prestigious awards available globally, providing the world's top researchers and their teams with funding support over eight years to support their research programs and teams.<br/>
<br/>
The CERC recruitment uses a two staged process where interested applicants must first apply to the open job posting at the University. The successful applicant from that first stage will then enter a second stage, for which they co-develop an application with the University to the federal government funding program. The University of Calgary will provide substantial institutional support in the preparation and development of the program application. Appointment to one of these positions is contingent upon the applicant being awarded a Canada Excellence Research Chair and is subject to the availability of funding and to final approval by the University Board of Governors and the Tri-agency Institutional Programs Secretariat (TIPS). Interested applicants are invited to review the full program details: https://www.cerc.gc.ca/program-programme/cpan-pccs-eng.aspx#2. Candidates who are unsuccessful in a CERC chair application at the national competition may be considered as a nominee for a Canada Research Chair (Tier I) in the areas identified below.
<br/>
<br/>
CERC Chair awardees will have up to 12 months to take up the award after the notice of award and acceptance has been signed by all parties.<br/>
<br/>
This program provides an opportunity for international researchers, including Canadian expatriates wishing to relocate to Canada, to lead a prestigious research program at the University of Calgary and to contribute to Canada's excellence in research and innovation. Applicants must be full professors or associate professors expected to be promoted to full professor within one to two years of the nomination. Successful applicants will have an outstanding track record of research contributions in their field including a commitment to equity, diversity and inclusion within their research ecosystems, and demonstrated leadership/mentorship within research teams.

<br/>
<b>University of Calgary CERC Theme - Intersection of Stress and Addiction</b>
<br/>
Addiction is a mental illness that knows no socio-economic, geographic, cultural, gender, or age boundaries. Morbidity and mortality associated with addiction have emerged as a public health crisis in Canada. Individuals who are subjected to stressors such as pain and/or inflammation, trauma, poverty, homelessness, adverse childhood experiences, mental illness, and loneliness are more likely to develop addiction. Additionally, the changes in brain circuits or behavior that occur following stress may favour compulsive substance use. Stress also plays a key role during drug withdrawal and life stressors are a key driver for resumption of drug use (relapse). Although there has been widespread interest in understanding how stress increases the likelihood of addiction and contributes to relapse, the underlying neurobiology remains unknown. Reducing the adverse impact of addiction must consider how environmental stressors and other socioeconomic determinants of health affect drug and alcohol consumption, and devise strategies to reduce the impact of these risk factors. The University of Calgary has developed a strong base in stress research and supports a rapidly growing addiction research group. The chair in the Intersection of Stress and Addiction will catalyze this expertise to address the burden of drug and alcohol addiction in Canada.<br/>

</p><p>The University of Calgary (UCalgary), located in the heart of Southern Alberta, both acknowledges and pays tribute to the traditional territories of the peoples of Treaty 7, which include the Blackfoot Confederacy (comprised of the Siksika, the Piikani, and the Kainai First Nations) as well as the Tsuut'ina First Nation, and the Stoney Nakoda (including Chiniki, Bearspaw, and Wesley First Nations). The university recognizes that the City of Calgary is also home to Region III of the Métis Nation of Alberta. By virtue of the signing of Treaty 7 in 1877, the university recognizes that we are all treaty people. The City of Calgary is home to a culturally diverse community. Together, we share this land, strive to live together, learn together, walk together, and grow together ""in a good way.""<br/>
<br/>
In the spring of 2016, UCalgary set out to build the Indigenous Strategy (ii'taa'poh'to'p) by gathering stories and perspectives from Traditional Knowledge Keepers, cultural advisors, agencies, and communities. The strategy was adopted in November 2017 with a foundation in transformation, renewal, and shared ethical space. It includes 27 recommendations that address ways of knowing, doing, connecting and being, touching on all aspects of the university. The university is enacting the strategy's directions through an Elders/UCalgary leadership Circle of Advisors, the UCalgary Indigenous Strategy Implementation Committee and its seven sub-committees, and the ii' taa'poh'to'p Student Circle of Advisors, as well as several other faculty-based committees and action plans.<br/>
<br/>
Ii'taa'poh'to'p guides UCalgary on its path of transformation and communicates its commitment and responsibility for truth and reconciliation.

The University of Calgary is committed to Indigenous Engagement and systemic change and is seeking candidates for a <b>Tier 2 Canada Research Chair (CRC) in the area of Weaving Indigenous Science and Sustainability Science </b>in the Faculty of Science. The successful candidate for the CRC will be appointed at the rank of Assistant Professor (tenure-track) or Associate Professor (with tenure). This recruitment will be complimented by additional appointments that will support continued Indigenization within the Faculty of Science, notably an Assistant Professor or Instructor in the area of Indigenous Science.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Canadian Research Chair</b><br/>
<br/>
The Canada Research Chairs Program stands at the centre of a national strategy to make Canada one of the world's top countries in research and development. It invests approximately $295 million per year to attract and retain a diverse cadre of world-class researchers, to reinforce academic research and training excellence in Canadian postsecondary institutions. Tier 2 Chairs are tenable for five years and renewable once. Tier 2 Chairs are intended for exceptional emerging scholars (i.e., candidates must have been an active researcher in their field for fewer than 10 years at the time of nomination). Candidates who are more than 10 years from having earned their highest degree and who have had career breaks, such as maternity, parental, or extended sick leave, clinical training, and research interruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic etc., may have their eligibility for a Tier 2 Chair assessed through the program's Tier 2 justification process. Please contact UCalgary's Office of Research Services for more information: ipd@ucalgary.ca. Further information about the Canada Research Chairs Program can be found on the Government of Canada's CRC website, including eligibility criteria: https://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.aspx
<br/>
<br/>
Applicants will have earned a PhD in a Science discipline with an area of specialization related to environmental impacts, remediation and/or sustainability. This CRC is a unique opportunity for innovative research weaving Indigenous and Western approaches, while fostering self-determination with regard to the research program.<br/>
<br/>
The Chair will establish an active research program that focuses on environmental impacts, remediation and sustainability of lands or water affected by resource extraction (e.g. mining, oilsands, pipelines), and aligns with ii'taa'poh'to'p and the University of Calgary's and the Faculty of Science strategic plans. Regardless of the Western focus, the Chair would combine their efforts with protocols inclusive of Indigenous ways of knowing and Indigenous communities. Namely, one or more of: community-based participatory research, interviews and other involvement of Elders and Knowledge Keepers, and ethnography. Remediation is complex, and meaningful progress requires combining Western reductionist approaches with honouring and incorporating the deep knowledge held by Indigenous peoples. The Chair will play an important role in teaching and research supervision of undergraduate and graduate students in one of the six departments in the Faculty of Science, based on their area of expertise. Service to the department, faculty, University, and community is also expected. The successful candidate ideally will have work/research experience in an Indigenous community.<br/>
<br/>
The Chair will have the opportunity to be part of a prolific and diverse research environment in the Faculty of Science, with access to state-of-the-art core infrastructure. Outstanding opportunities for collaboration are available to advance research within the research themes outlined in the 2018-2023 University Research Plan including Human Dynamics in a Changing World, Energy Innovations for Today and Tomorrow, as well as, focus areas of the One Health Initiative, including the Healthy Water Ecosystems and Healthy Communities. They will contribute to the Faculty of Science's Strategic Plan through the Grand Challenge of Understanding Earth's Evolving Systems and will engage with the University's new Growth Through Focus initiative by developing deeper community partnerships and building transdisciplinary scholarship in one of the areas of focus (Cities and Communities; Democracy and Social Change; Digital Worlds; Energy Transformation; Health and Life).<br/>
<br/>
The successful candidate at the <b>Assistant Professor</b> level must demonstrate evidence of a track record of publications in high quality journals, securing external research funding, and effectiveness in teaching at the University level. The successful candidate at the <b>Associate Professor</b> level must demonstrate evidence of a strong track record of publications in high quality journals, evidence of securing ongoing external research funding, effectiveness in teaching at the University level, and evidence of effective graduate student supervision.<br/>
