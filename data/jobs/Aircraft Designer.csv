However, legacy metal AM has been greatly limited in its capabilities since its invention almost 30 years ago. This has prevented the technology from being used to create the most valuable and impactful parts, restricting its use to specific niches where the limitations were acceptable.

Velo3D has overcome these limitations so engineers can design and print the parts they want. The company’s solution unlocks a wide breadth of design freedom and enables customers in space exploration, aviation, power generation, energy, and semiconductor to innovate the future in their respective industries. Using Velo3D, these customers can now build mission-critical metal parts that were previously impossible to manufacture. The end-to-end solution includes the Flow™ print preparation software, the Sapphire® family of printers, and the Assure™ quality control system—all of which are powered by Velo3D’s Intelligent Fusion® manufacturing process. The company delivered its first Sapphire® system in 2018 and has been a strategic partner to innovators such as SpaceX, Honeywell, Honda, Chromalloy, and Lam Research. Velo3D has been named to Fast Company’s prestigious annual list of the World’s Most Innovative Companies for 2021. For more information, please visit velo3d.com, or follow the company on LinkedIn or Twitter.

Given this commitment—and based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and state and local government and public health agencies—Velo3D, Inc. requires that all new hires receive a full course of an eligible FDA-approved vaccine [(including a vaccine approved under the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization power)], and provide proof of receipt of such vaccination, before their employment start date, unless an exemption is approved by Velo3D, Inc. The proof should be documentation evidencing vaccination; it should not contain any disability or other medical information. Vaccination status and documentation will be kept confidential. Velo3D, Inc. will engage in an interactive process to determine if a reasonable accommodation can be provided to those new hires who request an exemption from our vaccination policy due to a qualifying condition. If you reach out to HR, we can determine whether we can make an accommodation (hr@velo3d.com -- please only email for accommodation requests, all other requests should be sent through Lever).

You're likely aware of the first &amp; last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This 'dynamic shuttle' (or van /sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep, and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo's 'dynamic shuttle' platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.<br/>RideCo powers a diverse range of use cases, including residential/ suburban travel; first-mile-last-mile connections for transit hubs; and corporate employee transportation. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.</p><p> </p><p><em><strong>RideCo is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills.
