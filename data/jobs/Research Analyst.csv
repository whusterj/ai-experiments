We collaborate to identify and bring focus to rural issues, build local capacity, and find innovative, rural-based solutions to unique issues. Some of the key things RDN does are: managing and delivering projects and initiatives, helping to identify and access funding to support projects, performing services on a cost-recovery basis, identifying, creating, and sharing tools, information and expertise, and partnering with other organizations on projects to compliment their skills &amp; expertise, and boost their capacity.</p>

<p>About the Sustainable Housing Initiative:</p>
<p>In 2015, RDN created the Sustainable Housing Initiative (SHI) in direct response to rural and remote communities expressing their need for support in addressing the critical lack of affordable housing. This issue has not received the same attention and resources as it has in urban centres, and comes with unique challenges requiring unique solutions. The SHI consults with communities to conduct research, data analysis, produces housing needs assessments, business plans, financial models and more. This lays the groundwork necessary for projects to access funding from governments, banks, and other sources, which is often the biggest hurdle to overcome.</p>

<b><br/> Building an Antiracist and Equitable Team and Why it is Important to Us - A New Kind of Health Care for a Healthier Community</b>
</div>
<div>
    When we set out to build our vision and future, we connected with and heard from our community - patients, families, visitors, physicians, staff and volunteers. Our plan to create a new kind of health care for a healthier community means advancing health across the hospital, the system and the community and is built on an inter-connected system of care organized around patients and leaving no one behind. Recognizing this mission could not be realized without also assessing and investing in our internal practices, culture and processes we are building an organization where everyone at THP feels they belong, their voice matters, and contributes to our collective success. We commit to making systemic fairness a reality for all and are working to ensure that the community we serve is reflected at all levels, and in all professions at THP. Diversity is our strength and we recognize and value teaching and learning we all contribute and benefit from in our environment; our unique lived experiences matter and shape our actions and behaviors. In becoming an antiracist organization, we acknowledge the existence of oppression, racism, bias and complicity, and we have been working steadily to make changes in the way we work to dismantle these barriers. This includes developing and realizing an action plan to advance racial equity and embed anti-racism accountability across IBH, starting with our anti-Black racism priority initiative.

Building an Antiracist and Equitable Team and Why it is Important to Us - A New Kind of Health Care for a Healthier Community</b></div><div>
When we set out to build our vision and future, we connected with and heard from our community - patients, families, visitors, physicians, staff and volunteers. Our plan to create a new kind of health care for a healthier community means advancing health across the hospital, the system and the community and is built on an inter-connected system of care organized around patients and leaving no one behind. Recognizing this mission could not be realized without also assessing and investing in our internal practices, culture and processes we are building an organization where everyone at THP feels they belong, their voice matters, and contributes to our collective success. We commit to making systemic fairness a reality for all and are working to ensure that the community we serve is reflected at all levels, and in all professions at THP. Diversity is our strength and we recognize and value teaching and learning we all contribute and benefit from in our environment; our unique lived experiences matter and shape our actions and behaviors. In becoming an antiracist organization, we acknowledge the existence of oppression, racism, bias and complicity, and we have been working steadily to make changes in the way we work to dismantle these barriers. This includes developing and realizing an action plan to advance racial equity and embed anti-racism accountability across IBH, starting with our anti-Black racism priority initiative.</div><div></div><div><b><br/>

Building an Antiracist and Equitable Team and Why it is Important to Us - A New Kind of Health Care for a Healthier Community</b></div><div>
When we set out to build our vision and future, we connected with and heard from our community - patients, families, visitors, physicians, staff and volunteers. Our plan to create a new kind of health care for a healthier community means advancing health across the hospital, the system and the community and is built on an inter-connected system of care organized around patients and leaving no one behind. Recognizing this mission could not be realized without also assessing and investing in our internal practices, culture and processes we are building an organization where everyone at THP feels they belong, their voice matters, and contributes to our collective success. We commit to making systemic fairness a reality for all and are working to ensure that the community we serve is reflected at all levels, and in all professions at THP. Diversity is our strength and we recognize and value teaching and learning we all contribute and benefit from in our environment; our unique lived experiences matter and shape our actions and behaviors. In becoming an antiracist organization, we acknowledge the existence of oppression, racism, bias and complicity, and we have been working steadily to make changes in the way we work to dismantle these barriers. This includes developing and realizing an action plan to advance racial equity and embed anti-racism accountability across IBH, starting with our anti-Black racism priority initiative.</div><div></div><div><b><br/>

We then partner with our clients to design a comprehensive solution that draws on available data sources and custom data collection methods that we execute to fill the gaps. Finally, we generate deep insight through analysis and advise our clients on how to leverage that insight to answer the business question and, ultimately, drive their strategy.</p>

Building an Antiracist and Equitable Team and Why it is Important to Us - A New Kind of Health Care for a Healthier Community</b></div><div>
When we set out to build our vision and future, we connected with and heard from our community - patients, families, visitors, physicians, staff and volunteers. Our plan to create a new kind of health care for a healthier community means advancing health across the hospital, the system and the community and is built on an inter-connected system of care organized around patients and leaving no one behind. Recognizing this mission could not be realized without also assessing and investing in our internal practices, culture and processes we are building an organization where everyone at THP feels they belong, their voice matters, and contributes to our collective success. We commit to making systemic fairness a reality for all and are working to ensure that the community we serve is reflected at all levels, and in all professions at THP. Diversity is our strength and we recognize and value teaching and learning we all contribute and benefit from in our environment; our unique lived experiences matter and shape our actions and behaviors. In becoming an antiracist organization, we acknowledge the existence of oppression, racism, bias and complicity, and we have been working steadily to make changes in the way we work to dismantle these barriers. This includes developing and realizing an action plan to advance racial equity and embed anti-racism accountability across IBH, starting with our anti-Black racism priority initiative.</div><div></div><div><b><br/>

Building an Antiracist and Equitable Team and Why it is Important to Us - A New Kind of Health Care for a Healthier Community</b></div><div>
When we set out to build our vision and future, we connected with and heard from our community - patients, families, visitors, physicians, staff and volunteers. Our plan to create a new kind of health care for a healthier community means advancing health across the hospital, the system and the community and is built on an inter-connected system of care organized around patients and leaving no one behind. Recognizing this mission could not be realized without also assessing and investing in our internal practices, culture and processes we are building an organization where everyone at THP feels they belong, their voice matters, and contributes to our collective success. We commit to making systemic fairness a reality for all and are working to ensure that the community we serve is reflected at all levels, and in all professions at THP. Diversity is our strength and we recognize and value teaching and learning we all contribute and benefit from in our environment; our unique lived experiences matter and shape our actions and behaviors. In becoming an antiracist organization, we acknowledge the existence of oppression, racism, bias and complicity, and we have been working steadily to make changes in the way we work to dismantle these barriers. This includes developing and realizing an action plan to advance racial equity and embed anti-racism accountability across IBH, starting with our anti-Black racism priority initiative.</div><div></div><div><b><br/>

Building an Antiracist and Equitable Team and Why it is Important to Us - A New Kind of Health Care for a Healthier Community</b></div><div>
When we set out to build our vision and future, we connected with and heard from our community - patients, families, visitors, physicians, staff and volunteers. Our plan to create a new kind of health care for a healthier community means advancing health across the hospital, the system and the community and is built on an inter-connected system of care organized around patients and leaving no one behind. Recognizing this mission could not be realized without also assessing and investing in our internal practices, culture and processes we are building an organization where everyone at THP feels they belong, their voice matters, and contributes to our collective success. We commit to making systemic fairness a reality for all and are working to ensure that the community we serve is reflected at all levels, and in all professions at THP. Diversity is our strength and we recognize and value teaching and learning we all contribute and benefit from in our environment; our unique lived experiences matter and shape our actions and behaviors. In becoming an antiracist organization, we acknowledge the existence of oppression, racism, bias and complicity, and we have been working steadily to make changes in the way we work to dismantle these barriers. This includes developing and realizing an action plan to advance racial equity and embed anti-racism accountability across IBH, starting with our anti-Black racism priority initiative.</div><div></div><div><b><br/>

When we set out to build our vision and future, we connected with and heard from our community - patients, families, visitors, physicians, staff and volunteers. Our plan to create a new kind of health care for a healthier community means advancing health across the hospital, the system and the community and is built on an inter-connected system of care organized around patients and leaving no one behind. Recognizing this mission could not be realized without also assessing and investing in our internal practices, culture and processes we are building an organization where everyone at THP feels they belong, their voice matters, and contributes to our collective success. We commit to making systemic fairness a reality for all and are working to ensure that the community we serve is reflected at all levels, and in all professions at THP. Diversity is our strength and we recognize and value teaching and learning we all contribute and benefit from in our environment; our unique lived experiences matter and shape our actions and behaviors. In becoming an antiracist organization, we acknowledge the existence of oppression, racism, bias and complicity, and we have been working steadily to make changes in the way we work to dismantle these barriers. This includes developing and realizing an action plan to advance racial equity and embed anti-racism accountability across IBH, starting with our anti-Black racism priority initiative.</div><div></div><div><b><br/>

Finally, we generate deep insight through analysis and advise our clients on how to leverage that insight to answer the business question and, ultimately, drive their strategy.</p>

This issue has not received the same attention and resources as it has in urban centres, and comes with unique challenges requiring unique solutions. The SHI consults with communities to conduct research, data analysis, produces housing needs assessments, business plans, financial models and more. This lays the groundwork necessary for projects to access funding from governments, banks, and other sources, which is often the biggest hurdle to overcome.</p><p>To learn more about SHI, visit www.housingredefined.ca.</p><p>Job Type: Full-time</p><p>Salary: $55,000.00-$63,600.00 per year</p><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>Flexible schedule</li><li>RRSP match</li><li>Work from home</li></ul><p>Schedule:</p><ul><li>Monday to Friday</li></ul><p>Application question(s):</p><ul><li>Do you have experience working with large datasets?</li><li>Do you have experience using Adobe Creative or Cloud Suite?</li><li>Are you familiar with financial modelling and proformas?</li><li>Are you legally able to work in Canada?</li></ul></div></div><style data-emotion-css=""1rzz8ht"">.css-1rzz8ht{color:#1861bf;cursor:pointer;font-size:16px;font-weight:700;margin:16px;text-align:center;}.css-1rzz8ht svg{height:12px;width:12px;}</style><div class=""css-1rzz8ht ecgq1xb2"">Show more<!-- --> <svg height=""24"" viewbox=""0 0 24 24"" width=""24"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg""><path d=""M4.4 9.25l7.386 7.523a1 1 0 0 0 1.428 0L20.6 9.25c.5-.509.5-1.324 0-1.833a1.261 1.261 0 0 0-1.8 0l-6.3 6.416-6.3-6.416a1.261 1.261 0 0 0-1.8 0c-.5.509-.5 1.324 0 1.833z"" fill=""currentColor"" fill-rule=""evenodd""></path></svg></div></div>","['Flexible schedule', 'Write housing needs assessments, and business cases;', 'How to Apply:', 'Explore new opportunities to support communities and improve our work;', 'Do you have experience using Adobe Creative or Cloud Suite?', 'Define scope and project methodology as needed and create proposals for new projects;', 'Self-motivated with a high degree of integrity, honesty, and ethics;', 'Experience working with survey data and survey methodology;', 'Critically analyse data and make recommendations to address community needs;', 'Work from home', 'Participate in the planning and delivery of community engagement sessions;', 'RDN is committed to the safety and health of our team and people we work with.

Building an Antiracist and Equitable Team and Why it is Important to Us - A New Kind of Health Care for a Healthier Community</b></div><div>
When we set out to build our vision and future, we connected with and heard from our community - patients, families, visitors, physicians, staff and volunteers. Our plan to create a new kind of health care for a healthier community means advancing health across the hospital, the system and the community and is built on an inter-connected system of care organized around patients and leaving no one behind. Recognizing this mission could not be realized without also assessing and investing in our internal practices, culture and processes we are building an organization where everyone at THP feels they belong, their voice matters, and contributes to our collective success. We commit to making systemic fairness a reality for all and are working to ensure that the community we serve is reflected at all levels, and in all professions at THP. Diversity is our strength and we recognize and value teaching and learning we all contribute and benefit from in our environment; our unique lived experiences matter and shape our actions and behaviors. In becoming an antiracist organization, we acknowledge the existence of oppression, racism, bias and complicity, and we have been working steadily to make changes in the way we work to dismantle these barriers. This includes developing and realizing an action plan to advance racial equity and embed anti-racism accountability across IBH, starting with our anti-Black racism priority initiative.</div><div></div><div><b><br/>

Finally, we generate deep insight through analysis and advise our clients on how to leverage that insight to answer the business question and, ultimately, drive their strategy.</p>

The SHI consults with communities to conduct research, data analysis, produces housing needs assessments, business plans, financial models and more. This lays the groundwork necessary for projects to access funding from governments, banks, and other sources, which is often the biggest hurdle to overcome.</p><p>To learn more about SHI, visit www.housingredefined.ca.</p><p>Job Type: Full-time</p><p>Salary: $55,000.00-$63,600.00 per year</p><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>Flexible schedule</li><li>RRSP match</li><li>Work from home</li></ul><p>Schedule:</p><ul><li>Monday to Friday</li></ul><p>Application question(s):</p><ul><li>Do you have experience working with large datasets?</li><li>Do you have experience using Adobe Creative or Cloud Suite?</li><li>Are you familiar with financial modelling and proformas?</li><li>Are you legally able to work in Canada?</li></ul></div></div><style data-emotion-css=""1rzz8ht"">.css-1rzz8ht{color:#1861bf;cursor:pointer;font-size:16px;font-weight:700;margin:16px;text-align:center;}.css-1rzz8ht svg{height:12px;width:12px;}</style><div class=""css-1rzz8ht ecgq1xb2"">Show more<!-- --> <svg height=""24"" viewbox=""0 0 24 24"" width=""24"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg""><path d=""M4.4 9.25l7.386 7.523a1 1 0 0 0 1.428 0L20.6 9.25c.5-.509.5-1.324 0-1.833a1.261 1.261 0 0 0-1.8 0l-6.3 6.416-6.3-6.416a1.261 1.261 0 0 0-1.8 0c-.5.509-.5 1.324 0 1.833z"" fill=""currentColor"" fill-rule=""evenodd""></path></svg></div></div>","['Flexible schedule', 'Write housing needs assessments, and business cases;', 'How to Apply:', 'Explore new opportunities to support communities and improve our work;', 'Do you have experience using Adobe Creative or Cloud Suite?', 'Define scope and project methodology as needed and create proposals for new projects;', 'Self-motivated with a high degree of integrity, honesty, and ethics;', 'Experience working with survey data and survey methodology;', 'Critically analyse data and make recommendations to address community needs;', 'Work from home', 'Participate in the planning and delivery of community engagement sessions;', 'RDN is committed to the safety and health of our team and people we work with.

Building an Antiracist and Equitable Team and Why it is Important to Us - A New Kind of Health Care for a Healthier Community</b></div><div>
When we set out to build our vision and future, we connected with and heard from our community - patients, families, visitors, physicians, staff and volunteers. Our plan to create a new kind of health care for a healthier community means advancing health across the hospital, the system and the community and is built on an inter-connected system of care organized around patients and leaving no one behind. Recognizing this mission could not be realized without also assessing and investing in our internal practices, culture and processes we are building an organization where everyone at THP feels they belong, their voice matters, and contributes to our collective success. We commit to making systemic fairness a reality for all and are working to ensure that the community we serve is reflected at all levels, and in all professions at THP. Diversity is our strength and we recognize and value teaching and learning we all contribute and benefit from in our environment; our unique lived experiences matter and shape our actions and behaviors. In becoming an antiracist organization, we acknowledge the existence of oppression, racism, bias and complicity, and we have been working steadily to make changes in the way we work to dismantle these barriers. This includes developing and realizing an action plan to advance racial equity and embed anti-racism accountability across IBH, starting with our anti-Black racism priority initiative.</div><div></div><div><b><br/>

Building an Antiracist and Equitable Team and Why it is Important to Us - A New Kind of Health Care for a Healthier Community</b></div><div>
When we set out to build our vision and future, we connected with and heard from our community - patients, families, visitors, physicians, staff and volunteers. Our plan to create a new kind of health care for a healthier community means advancing health across the hospital, the system and the community and is built on an inter-connected system of care organized around patients and leaving no one behind. Recognizing this mission could not be realized without also assessing and investing in our internal practices, culture and processes we are building an organization where everyone at THP feels they belong, their voice matters, and contributes to our collective success. We commit to making systemic fairness a reality for all and are working to ensure that the community we serve is reflected at all levels, and in all professions at THP. Diversity is our strength and we recognize and value teaching and learning we all contribute and benefit from in our environment; our unique lived experiences matter and shape our actions and behaviors. In becoming an antiracist organization, we acknowledge the existence of oppression, racism, bias and complicity, and we have been working steadily to make changes in the way we work to dismantle these barriers. This includes developing and realizing an action plan to advance racial equity and embed anti-racism accountability across IBH, starting with our anti-Black racism priority initiative.</div><div></div><div><b><br/>
