<br/> Touching Lives! Room for Growth! Independent Practice! These are just a few of the descriptions that describe Interior Health’s High Acuity Response Team (HART) program and we are seeking critical care trained and experienced transport nurses to be part of this new and innovative program. 
    <br/>
<br/> This program provides comprehensive, regionally coordinated ground transport care for critical care patients from institutions. Our mobile critical care response team includes highly skilled nursing professionals who perform vital analyses and procedures as needed on-site and in transit. This ground transport team covers Central and South Okanagan- from Kelowna to Oosyoos and Princeton to Grand Forks- to provide critical care in outlying facilities and transport patients to the best available care as quickly as possible.
    <br/>
<br/> Providing interfacility transportation for patients requiring advanced life support (ALS) or critical care management to or from tertiary hospitals is of particular importance, and is one of the primary reasons for using the Penticton HART team. 
    <br/>
<br/> The service will bring critical care nurses by ambulance to the hospital when a situation requires an advanced level of care that the ambulance crew cannot perform. These nurses work under the medical direction of the regional medical director and utilize standing protocols which provide advanced medical care and will enhance the emergency lifesaving capabilities of the local EMS providers.
    <br/>
<br/> When not involved in transports, HART RNs integrate into their base hospital by providing support to critical care areas such as ICU and ER, participating in rapid response, code blue, critical care outreach to the wards, rounding on recent ICU discharges and other duties as required.
    <br/>
<br/> If you like a challenge when you work, opportunities for funded training, and choices when you play, Interior Health is the place for you!

<br/><br/>
Note - Pay Rate for this Job is $16.00/Hour - $17.00/Hour
<br/><br/>
Shift Timing - All Available
<br/><br/>
<b>Responsibilities Include:</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>A traffic control person may also be known as a flag person (flag woman/flag man) or signaler. The main role is to:</li>
<li>Stop, slow, and safely direct traffic through work or construction sites.</li>
<li>Protect workers in the construction zone by regulating traffic flow.</li>
<li>Give traffic control directions and signals clearly and precisely so that motorists understand their meaning.</li>
<li>Keep the flow of traffic moving with as few delays as possible.</li>
<li>Only use traffic control persons when other methods of traffic control are not adequate.</li>
<li>Always use barriers, barricades, lane control devices, traffic signal lights, sign trucks, and other methods as appropriate instead of, and/or in addition to, traffic control persons to ensure the safety of all workers.</li>
<li>What should a traffic control person know before each job? Before starting each job, know:</li>
<li>The overall traffic protection plan and layout of the traffic control zone.</li>
<li>Your duties, role and responsibilities.</li>
<li>That you have the right training for this job, and that you understand your duties.</li>
<li>What activities will be done on the work or construction site (e.g., paving, grading, etc.).</li>
<li>What equipment is present and how the equipment will be operated (e.g., scrapers, trucks, graders, etc.).</li>
<li>What personal protective equipment is required.</li>
<li>Practices and procedures for that job (how to stop and slow traffic), where to stand, etc. The traffic control zone will vary depending on the speed allowed on the roadway, volume of traffic, weather conditions, if there is a curve or hill, etc.</li>
<li>What communication methods will be used, including how to use radios, hand signals, etc.</li>
<li>What to do in an emergency, including your personal escape route in case a vehicle comes too close.</li>
<li>Be sure you have adequate eye sight and hearing ability to do this job safely.</li>
<li>How communication will be handled if there is a need for a third (or more) traffic control person, such as when the work zone is around curves or hills where sight lines to the other end of the work zone are obstructed.</li>
<li>That the “stop-slow” sign you will use is in good repair (e.g., undamaged, clean).</li>
<li>That measures are in place and at appropriate distances to give motorist enough warning to slow down.</li>
<li>How to report incidents (near-misses, accidents, etc.).</li>
<li>That a traffic control person should never leave their position unattended (e.g., know what the arrangements are for meals and breaks).</li>
</ul>
<b>Qualifications:</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Always stay alert. The situation can change very quickly.</li>
<li>Be visible. Stand where you can see traffic, and be seen by traffic.</li>
<li>Think ahead and plan your escape route. Know where you will move to if a motorist drives too close.</li>
<li>Stand “alone”, which in this case means do not stand in a group of people, or beside or in a vehicle or other distractions. Drivers must be able to see you clearly.</li>
<li>Stand the correct distance from the work area. This position will vary with the visibility, speed and volume of traffic. In general, this spot is halfway between the beginning of the taper or detour zone, and the traffic control person sign. Do not stand too close to the taper, or in the travel lane.</li>
<li>Keep visual contact with the other traffic control person if you are not using radios.</li>
<li>Work as a team with other traffic control persons. Always check with the other traffic control person to see if it is safe to allow traffic to move. When two or more traffic control persons are required to work as a team at the worksite, responsibility for coordination of changes in traffic flow could be assigned to one person.</li>
<li>Hold the stop/slow sign away from your body, and in the driver's line of sight.</li>
<li>Raise your free hand with the palm facing the driver to stop traffic.</li>
<li>Allow time for the vehicle to stop safely by turning the sign when the vehicle is at an appropriate distance away for the speed it is travelling.</li>
<li>After stopping the first vehicle, move to a safe position where the incoming next vehicle can see you.</li>
<li>Be aware of everything going on around you, behind you, lane beside you, etc.</li>
<li>When you are ready to release traffic, return to your position outside the travel lane, confirm with the other traffic control person it is safe to let traffic move, turn the sign to “slow”, and with your free arm, signal to drivers to proceed.</li>
<li>To slow moving traffic, extend the slow sign away from your body (but do not wave it), and use your free hand in an up and down motion (palm down).</li>
<li>Be alert for emergency vehicles (police, fire, ambulance). These vehicles have priority through the traffic control zone.</li>
<li>Guide cyclists and pedestrians safely through the zone as well.</li>
<li>Cover or remove traffic control person signs when there are no traffic control persons present.</li>
<li>Do not assume a vehicle will stop until it has actually come to a full and complete stop.</li>
<li>Do not look away from on-coming traffic.</li>
<li>Do not do any other activity, other than control traffic.</li>

<br/><br/>
Note - Pay Rate for this Job is $16.00/Hour - $17.00/Hour
<br/><br/>
Shift Timing - All Available
<br/><br/>
<b>Responsibilities Include:</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>A traffic control person may also be known as a flag person (flag woman/flag man) or signaler. The main role is to:</li>
<li>Stop, slow, and safely direct traffic through work or construction sites.</li>
<li>Protect workers in the construction zone by regulating traffic flow.</li>
<li>Give traffic control directions and signals clearly and precisely so that motorists understand their meaning.</li>
<li>Keep the flow of traffic moving with as few delays as possible.</li>
<li>Only use traffic control persons when other methods of traffic control are not adequate.</li>
<li>Always use barriers, barricades, lane control devices, traffic signal lights, sign trucks, and other methods as appropriate instead of, and/or in addition to, traffic control persons to ensure the safety of all workers.</li>
<li>What should a traffic control person know before each job? Before starting each job, know:</li>
<li>The overall traffic protection plan and layout of the traffic control zone.</li>
<li>Your duties, role and responsibilities.</li>
<li>That you have the right training for this job, and that you understand your duties.</li>
<li>What activities will be done on the work or construction site (e.g., paving, grading, etc.).</li>
<li>What equipment is present and how the equipment will be operated (e.g., scrapers, trucks, graders, etc.).</li>
<li>What personal protective equipment is required.</li>
<li>Practices and procedures for that job (how to stop and slow traffic), where to stand, etc. The traffic control zone will vary depending on the speed allowed on the roadway, volume of traffic, weather conditions, if there is a curve or hill, etc.</li>
<li>What communication methods will be used, including how to use radios, hand signals, etc.</li>
<li>What to do in an emergency, including your personal escape route in case a vehicle comes too close.</li>
<li>Be sure you have adequate eye sight and hearing ability to do this job safely.</li>
<li>How communication will be handled if there is a need for a third (or more) traffic control person, such as when the work zone is around curves or hills where sight lines to the other end of the work zone are obstructed.</li>
<li>That the “stop-slow” sign you will use is in good repair (e.g., undamaged, clean).</li>
<li>That measures are in place and at appropriate distances to give motorist enough warning to slow down.</li>
<li>How to report incidents (near-misses, accidents, etc.).</li>
<li>That a traffic control person should never leave their position unattended (e.g., know what the arrangements are for meals and breaks).</li>
</ul>
<b>Qualifications:</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Always stay alert. The situation can change very quickly.</li>
<li>Be visible. Stand where you can see traffic, and be seen by traffic.</li>
<li>Think ahead and plan your escape route. Know where you will move to if a motorist drives too close.</li>
<li>Stand “alone”, which in this case means do not stand in a group of people, or beside or in a vehicle or other distractions. Drivers must be able to see you clearly.</li>
<li>Stand the correct distance from the work area. This position will vary with the visibility, speed and volume of traffic. In general, this spot is halfway between the beginning of the taper or detour zone, and the traffic control person sign. Do not stand too close to the taper, or in the travel lane.</li>
<li>Keep visual contact with the other traffic control person if you are not using radios.</li>
<li>Work as a team with other traffic control persons. Always check with the other traffic control person to see if it is safe to allow traffic to move. When two or more traffic control persons are required to work as a team at the worksite, responsibility for coordination of changes in traffic flow could be assigned to one person.</li>
<li>Hold the stop/slow sign away from your body, and in the driver's line of sight.</li>
<li>Raise your free hand with the palm facing the driver to stop traffic.</li>
<li>Allow time for the vehicle to stop safely by turning the sign when the vehicle is at an appropriate distance away for the speed it is travelling.</li>
<li>After stopping the first vehicle, move to a safe position where the incoming next vehicle can see you.</li>
<li>Be aware of everything going on around you, behind you, lane beside you, etc.</li>
<li>When you are ready to release traffic, return to your position outside the travel lane, confirm with the other traffic control person it is safe to let traffic move, turn the sign to “slow”, and with your free arm, signal to drivers to proceed.</li>
<li>To slow moving traffic, extend the slow sign away from your body (but do not wave it), and use your free hand in an up and down motion (palm down).</li>
<li>Be alert for emergency vehicles (police, fire, ambulance). These vehicles have priority through the traffic control zone.</li>
<li>Guide cyclists and pedestrians safely through the zone as well.</li>
<li>Cover or remove traffic control person signs when there are no traffic control persons present.</li>
<li>Do not assume a vehicle will stop until it has actually come to a full and complete stop.</li>
<li>Do not look away from on-coming traffic.</li>
<li>Do not do any other activity, other than control traffic.</li>

Touching Lives! Room for Growth! Independent Practice! These are just a few of the descriptions that describe Interior Health’s High Acuity Response Team (HART) program and we are seeking critical care trained and experienced transport nurses to be part of this new and innovative program.
<br/>
<br/>
This program provides comprehensive, regionally coordinated ground transport care for critical care patients from institutions. Our mobile critical care response team includes highly skilled nursing professionals who perform vital analyses and procedures as needed on-site and in transit. This ground transport team covers Central and South Okanagan- from Kelowna to Oosyoos and Princeton to Grand Forks- to provide critical care in outlying facilities and transport patients to the best available care as quickly as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Providing interfacility transportation for patients requiring advanced life support (ALS) or critical care management to or from tertiary hospitals is of particular importance, and is one of the primary reasons for using the Penticton HART team.
<br/>
<br/>
The service will bring critical care nurses by ambulance to the hospital when a situation requires an advanced level of care that the ambulance crew cannot perform. These nurses work under the medical direction of the regional medical director and utilize standing protocols which provide advanced medical care and will enhance the emergency lifesaving capabilities of the local EMS providers.<br/>
<br/>
When not involved in transports, HART RNs integrate into their base hospital by providing support to critical care areas such as ICU and ER, participating in rapid response, code blue, critical care outreach to the wards, rounding on recent ICU discharges and other duties as required.<br/>
<br/>

<br/><br/>
Note - Pay Rate for this Job is $16.00/Hour - $17.00/Hour
<br/><br/>
Shift Timing - All Available
<br/><br/>
<b>Responsibilities Include:</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>A traffic control person may also be known as a flag person (flag woman/flag man) or signaler. The main role is to:</li>
<li>Stop, slow, and safely direct traffic through work or construction sites.</li>
<li>Protect workers in the construction zone by regulating traffic flow.</li>
<li>Give traffic control directions and signals clearly and precisely so that motorists understand their meaning.</li>
<li>Keep the flow of traffic moving with as few delays as possible.</li>
<li>Only use traffic control persons when other methods of traffic control are not adequate.</li>
<li>Always use barriers, barricades, lane control devices, traffic signal lights, sign trucks, and other methods as appropriate instead of, and/or in addition to, traffic control persons to ensure the safety of all workers.</li>
<li>What should a traffic control person know before each job? Before starting each job, know:</li>
<li>The overall traffic protection plan and layout of the traffic control zone.</li>
<li>Your duties, role and responsibilities.</li>
<li>That you have the right training for this job, and that you understand your duties.</li>
<li>What activities will be done on the work or construction site (e.g., paving, grading, etc.).</li>
<li>What equipment is present and how the equipment will be operated (e.g., scrapers, trucks, graders, etc.).</li>
<li>What personal protective equipment is required.</li>
<li>Practices and procedures for that job (how to stop and slow traffic), where to stand, etc. The traffic control zone will vary depending on the speed allowed on the roadway, volume of traffic, weather conditions, if there is a curve or hill, etc.</li>
<li>What communication methods will be used, including how to use radios, hand signals, etc.</li>
<li>What to do in an emergency, including your personal escape route in case a vehicle comes too close.</li>
<li>Be sure you have adequate eye sight and hearing ability to do this job safely.</li>
<li>How communication will be handled if there is a need for a third (or more) traffic control person, such as when the work zone is around curves or hills where sight lines to the other end of the work zone are obstructed.</li>
<li>That the “stop-slow” sign you will use is in good repair (e.g., undamaged, clean).</li>
<li>That measures are in place and at appropriate distances to give motorist enough warning to slow down.</li>
<li>How to report incidents (near-misses, accidents, etc.).</li>
<li>That a traffic control person should never leave their position unattended (e.g., know what the arrangements are for meals and breaks).</li>
</ul>
<b>Qualifications:</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Always stay alert. The situation can change very quickly.</li>
<li>Be visible. Stand where you can see traffic, and be seen by traffic.</li>
<li>Think ahead and plan your escape route. Know where you will move to if a motorist drives too close.</li>
<li>Stand “alone”, which in this case means do not stand in a group of people, or beside or in a vehicle or other distractions. Drivers must be able to see you clearly.</li>
<li>Stand the correct distance from the work area. This position will vary with the visibility, speed and volume of traffic. In general, this spot is halfway between the beginning of the taper or detour zone, and the traffic control person sign. Do not stand too close to the taper, or in the travel lane.</li>
<li>Keep visual contact with the other traffic control person if you are not using radios.</li>
<li>Work as a team with other traffic control persons. Always check with the other traffic control person to see if it is safe to allow traffic to move. When two or more traffic control persons are required to work as a team at the worksite, responsibility for coordination of changes in traffic flow could be assigned to one person.</li>
<li>Hold the stop/slow sign away from your body, and in the driver's line of sight.</li>
<li>Raise your free hand with the palm facing the driver to stop traffic.</li>
<li>Allow time for the vehicle to stop safely by turning the sign when the vehicle is at an appropriate distance away for the speed it is travelling.</li>
<li>After stopping the first vehicle, move to a safe position where the incoming next vehicle can see you.</li>
<li>Be aware of everything going on around you, behind you, lane beside you, etc.</li>
<li>When you are ready to release traffic, return to your position outside the travel lane, confirm with the other traffic control person it is safe to let traffic move, turn the sign to “slow”, and with your free arm, signal to drivers to proceed.</li>
<li>To slow moving traffic, extend the slow sign away from your body (but do not wave it), and use your free hand in an up and down motion (palm down).</li>
<li>Be alert for emergency vehicles (police, fire, ambulance). These vehicles have priority through the traffic control zone.</li>
<li>Guide cyclists and pedestrians safely through the zone as well.</li>
<li>Cover or remove traffic control person signs when there are no traffic control persons present.</li>
<li>Do not assume a vehicle will stop until it has actually come to a full and complete stop.</li>
<li>Do not look away from on-coming traffic.</li>
<li>Do not do any other activity, other than control traffic.</li>
<li>Do not use other devices (other than your communication radio) which may distract you or impair your sight, hearing or take attention from the job. These devices include personal music players, cell phones, etc. Only use a cell phone for on-site emergency communication, if permitted.</li>
<li>Do not participate in arguments with motorists. Be polite, do not retaliate, stay back, and stay safe. If necessary, record the incident and report it to your supervisor.</li>
<li>Do not try to enforce situations that appear to be breaking highway traffic acts (e.g., speeding, dangerous driving, driving while impaired, etc.). Make a note of the licence plate on the vehicle, and discuss with your supervisor. Call the police or emergency services for assistance.</li>
<li>Do not use radio communication when blasting activities are occurring.</li>

<br/><br/>
Note - Pay Rate for this Job is $16.00/Hour - $17.00/Hour
<br/><br/>
Shift Timing - All Available
<br/><br/>
<b>Responsibilities Include:</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>A traffic control person may also be known as a flag person (flag woman/flag man) or signaler. The main role is to:</li>
<li>Stop, slow, and safely direct traffic through work or construction sites.</li>
<li>Protect workers in the construction zone by regulating traffic flow.</li>
<li>Give traffic control directions and signals clearly and precisely so that motorists understand their meaning.</li>
<li>Keep the flow of traffic moving with as few delays as possible.</li>
<li>Only use traffic control persons when other methods of traffic control are not adequate.</li>
<li>Always use barriers, barricades, lane control devices, traffic signal lights, sign trucks, and other methods as appropriate instead of, and/or in addition to, traffic control persons to ensure the safety of all workers.</li>
<li>What should a traffic control person know before each job? Before starting each job, know:</li>
<li>The overall traffic protection plan and layout of the traffic control zone.</li>
<li>Your duties, role and responsibilities.</li>
<li>That you have the right training for this job, and that you understand your duties.</li>
<li>What activities will be done on the work or construction site (e.g., paving, grading, etc.).</li>
<li>What equipment is present and how the equipment will be operated (e.g., scrapers, trucks, graders, etc.).</li>
<li>What personal protective equipment is required.</li>
<li>Practices and procedures for that job (how to stop and slow traffic), where to stand, etc. The traffic control zone will vary depending on the speed allowed on the roadway, volume of traffic, weather conditions, if there is a curve or hill, etc.</li>
<li>What communication methods will be used, including how to use radios, hand signals, etc.</li>
<li>What to do in an emergency, including your personal escape route in case a vehicle comes too close.</li>
<li>Be sure you have adequate eye sight and hearing ability to do this job safely.</li>
<li>How communication will be handled if there is a need for a third (or more) traffic control person, such as when the work zone is around curves or hills where sight lines to the other end of the work zone are obstructed.</li>
<li>That the “stop-slow” sign you will use is in good repair (e.g., undamaged, clean).</li>
<li>That measures are in place and at appropriate distances to give motorist enough warning to slow down.</li>
<li>How to report incidents (near-misses, accidents, etc.).</li>
<li>That a traffic control person should never leave their position unattended (e.g., know what the arrangements are for meals and breaks).</li>
</ul>
<b>Qualifications:</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Always stay alert. The situation can change very quickly.</li>
<li>Be visible. Stand where you can see traffic, and be seen by traffic.</li>
<li>Think ahead and plan your escape route. Know where you will move to if a motorist drives too close.</li>
<li>Stand “alone”, which in this case means do not stand in a group of people, or beside or in a vehicle or other distractions. Drivers must be able to see you clearly.</li>
<li>Stand the correct distance from the work area. This position will vary with the visibility, speed and volume of traffic. In general, this spot is halfway between the beginning of the taper or detour zone, and the traffic control person sign. Do not stand too close to the taper, or in the travel lane.</li>
<li>Keep visual contact with the other traffic control person if you are not using radios.</li>
<li>Work as a team with other traffic control persons. Always check with the other traffic control person to see if it is safe to allow traffic to move. When two or more traffic control persons are required to work as a team at the worksite, responsibility for coordination of changes in traffic flow could be assigned to one person.</li>
<li>Hold the stop/slow sign away from your body, and in the driver's line of sight.</li>
<li>Raise your free hand with the palm facing the driver to stop traffic.</li>
<li>Allow time for the vehicle to stop safely by turning the sign when the vehicle is at an appropriate distance away for the speed it is travelling.</li>
<li>After stopping the first vehicle, move to a safe position where the incoming next vehicle can see you.</li>
<li>Be aware of everything going on around you, behind you, lane beside you, etc.</li>
<li>When you are ready to release traffic, return to your position outside the travel lane, confirm with the other traffic control person it is safe to let traffic move, turn the sign to “slow”, and with your free arm, signal to drivers to proceed.</li>
<li>To slow moving traffic, extend the slow sign away from your body (but do not wave it), and use your free hand in an up and down motion (palm down).</li>
<li>Be alert for emergency vehicles (police, fire, ambulance). These vehicles have priority through the traffic control zone.</li>
<li>Guide cyclists and pedestrians safely through the zone as well.</li>
<li>Cover or remove traffic control person signs when there are no traffic control persons present.</li>
<li>Do not assume a vehicle will stop until it has actually come to a full and complete stop.</li>
<li>Do not look away from on-coming traffic.</li>
<li>Do not do any other activity, other than control traffic.</li>
<li>Do not use other devices (other than your communication radio) which may distract you or impair your sight, hearing or take attention from the job. These devices include personal music players, cell phones, etc. Only use a cell phone for on-site emergency communication, if permitted.</li>
<li>Do not participate in arguments with motorists. Be polite, do not retaliate, stay back, and stay safe. If necessary, record the incident and report it to your supervisor.</li>
<li>Do not try to enforce situations that appear to be breaking highway traffic acts (e.g., speeding, dangerous driving, driving while impaired, etc.). Make a note of the licence plate on the vehicle, and discuss with your supervisor. Call the police or emergency services for assistance.</li>
<li>Do not use radio communication when blasting activities are occurring.</li>
<li>Able to work outdoors in all weather conditions</li>
<li>Communication skills required - flaggers remain in constant contact with the crew</li>
