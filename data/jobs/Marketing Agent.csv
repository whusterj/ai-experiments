The IBH creates diverse and meaningful partnerships within and beyond Trillium Health Partners with the aim of improving the health of our community. Through this, IBH supports a diverse spectrum of research across THP, including biomedical, clinical, population health, health services and educational research, as well as leads research focused on population health and improving health services.   THPs mission of creating a new kind of health care for a healthier community is enabled by strategic research partnerships and collaboration of health researchers.

Research shows that even with new technology and drugs, children and youth living with diabetes are still not meeting recommended treatment targets. For example, their blood sugar control is poor, and they are more likely to have lower quality of life and develop other health problems such as heart or kidney disease. This is in part due to poor access to diabetes healthcare, which is worse in disadvantaged populations across Canada. We will develop strategies to address these gaps: The CAnadian PediAtric diabetes ConstortIum (CAPACIty) is a network of 10 childhood diabetes centres from across Canada, and their doctors and researchers who specialize in childhood diabetes. We will partner with patients/families and healthcare professionals to jointly design a Canada-wide childhood diabetes registry that will support improvements in clinical care, advance research, and inspire action by policymakers like improving coverage of diabetes technology and expanding support for diabetes in school. We will: (1) create an Advisory Board that will guide all aspects of the project and will include people living with/caring for a child with diabetes, health care professionals, researchers, and policymakers; (2) design and implement, in partnership with the Advisory Board, a childhood diabetes registry and quality improvement initiative called â€˜audit &amp; feedbackâ€™ where key clinical measures, that matter most to patients and families, are compared between Canadian diabetes centres; and (3) evaluate how this registry and audit &amp; feedback initiative inform action across all parts of the system including healthcare, research, policy and education. We are unique because we will focus on measuring indicators of inequality so that our strategies will positively impact the most disadvantaged children and youth living with diabetes, and their families.</p><p style=""margin:0px"">  </p><p style=""margin:0px""><strong>Role Requirements</strong></p><p style=""margin:0px"">The successful candidate must meet the following qualification and

You will focus on the question, “How do we better understand our users and their needs and motivations?” and iterate based on user feedback. The scope of your work will range from broad, exploratory research to inform product and company direction, to more focused studies.</p><p><br/></p><p>You will coordinate, design, and conduct qualitative and quantitative studies, and share your findings with the wider company, so that everyone has a common understanding of who our users are and the problems we’re trying to solve.

We ask for a lot, but we give a lot in return: We pay well and our benefits are amazing. You can find this job anywhere, but it’s the intangibles that make the experience worthwhile.
