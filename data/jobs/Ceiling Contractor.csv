<b>About New City Contracting Ltd.:</b>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Over 20 years ago, Edward Buset — New City’s founder and president — saw that the Lower Mainland was missing something: a resource for property managers, homeowner associations (HOAs), engineers, and other professionals involved in the building renewal business. Edward envisioned this resource that will work on new builds or maintain existing buildings, one that will develop cost-effective plans for the renewal of all types of buildings in our area’s unique climate. From this vision rose today’s New City, one of Vancouver’s leading general contractors. With over two decades of experience, New City is staffed with an amazing group of professionals, engineers, project managers, and people from different trades that delivers reliable and cost-effective solutions to a wide range of building renewal challenges on both new and existing buildings. We know what needs to be done, when it needs to be done, and how to get it done — in the most beneficial way for the building. Whether its envelope renewal, deep renovation, concrete restoration, or other building envelope management concerns, New City has the expertise and resources to handle the largest and most complex work smoothly and efficiently. Today, New City Contracting is a trusted leader in envelope renewal for commercial and residential projects. New City is an expert in the investigation, analysis, and repair of building envelopes — for all material types and vintages. Our extensive building renewal services include: Building Envelope RenewalExterior and Interior PaintingRoof Renewal and ReplacementTenant ImprovementWaterproofingExterior and Industrial CleaningEnvironmental AbatementConcrete Restoration</p>
