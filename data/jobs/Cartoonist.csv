While on that journey, we recognize that building a startup is very hard. Turning vision into reality in a fast-growing environment takes superhuman efforts and is often one of the most difficult, yet rewarding, things one can do. Every day there are new sets of challenges to be solved at an unprecedented speed. While startups are hard, the opportunity to do career-defining work and create an economic impact, solve hard problems with incredible team members and make the world a better place, can be extremely satisfying.</p><p>While we make a conscious effort to balance hard work and personal life, we recognize that we may not be for everyone. Here are some reasons why:</p><ul><li style=""font-weight:400"">We're solving hard problems, and with that comes change, priority shifts, and iteration. If formal structure and order is what you crave, this may not be a fit.</li><li style=""font-weight:400"">Execution is everything to us. Like any hyper growth startup, we will always be resource constrained and have to do more with less. We can not let that come in the way of execution as we simply must get sh*t done. If you desire an environment with ample resources at all times, we may not be for you.</li><li style=""font-weight:400"">We move fast. Very fast. We work with tight deadlines and operate with a sense of urgency in everything we do. Sometimes we make low data choices, test and retest until we succeed, and learn from our mistakes. If you're more of a 'get it perfect the first time' person, you may not thrive in our operating style.</li><li style=""font-weight:400"">With our value of 'take extreme ownership' comes a high degree of responsibility. The phrase 'that's not my job' is not part of our vocabulary. If we put our name on something, it is on us to ensure it gets completed. That can, sometimes, mean late nights or long hours. If you're looking for a structured 40 hours/week position, this may not be the place for you. </li><li style=""font-weight:400"">ResQ operates as one team on the same path to achieve our mission. At times we have opposing views and have to disagree, and commit. There is no ego here, as we do what is best for our customers. If you're used to always getting your way, you probably won't feel comfortable with our culture. </li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>What you'll enjoy about ResQ as a Full-Time Employee: </strong></p><p><strong>We believe in taking care of each other, and here are some ways we support our team to be their best selves.</strong></p><p> </p><div><div><div><div><p><strong>Health &amp; Wellness</strong></p>●  Financial Health: Competitive compensation and stock option grants that encourage you to grow and stay at ResQ</div><div>●  No limit on paid sick days, we trust our employees to take the time they need to recover</div><div>●  Enhanced health &amp; dental benefits for you and your family that start from day one</div><div>●  Top of market parental leave to help you focus on what matters the most</div><div>●  Flex-place options that balance in-office and remote working</div><div>●  All in-office employees are fully vaccinated for COVID-19<p> </p><p><strong>Paid-time off &amp; away</strong></p>●  Yes, we have <strong>Unlimited Vacation</strong> but we recognize that many Unlimited Vacation programs have the opposite result by reducing the time employees take off.

Position: Designer, Information Design (All levels)
Reports to: Senior Director, Information Design

Role Description and Expectations

Hi there! We are looking for designers to join our Growth Design team who will craft visual presentations and long documents for business pitches. Whether seasoned in the craft or recently graduated, if you’re someone who loves all things information design, this is the job for you!

As a designer at Klick who is an expert when it comes to information design, you are a visual problem solver—you dissect complex information to simplify and abstract it. You make presentations that don’t look like presentations. You see slides as an artboard, and you are excited to convey dense information in a manner that is both visually appealing and is easily digestible for the audience.

We love passionate people and we want to see what you’re passionate about! We have created a small (completely optional) design challenge for you to show us your stuff! 

Please design a landscape sized infographic about what you love. Whether you’re passionate about sports or you’re an avid foodie that knows all the best brunch places in Toronto, we want to see this! We want to see YOU on an artboard—bonus if you do it on a powerpoint slide. If you’re up for this challenge, we would love to learn more about you via this infographic. 

Please note: All candidates must submit samples, a portfolio, or link to a personal website to be considered. Those who complete the optional design challenge will receive a call from our recruiters and feedback from one of our design leads.




What makes Klick different?
You’ll work on numerous multi-million dollar brands—the size and breadth of the accounts here are incomparable to most agencies. We believe in putting our people first, and always make that our priority. This and our other timeless principles have made all the difference in our over two decades of success. By having an entrepreneurial spirit, playing the long game, considering outcomes over optics, and solving challenging problems through our hacker roots, we live our difference in all that we do. You’ll get to experience a high level of trust and be given the freedom to make decisions, judgment calls, and function with autonomy. If you have an idea, run with it! You’ll be encouraged to let your entrepreneurial spirit flourish and you’ll work with incredible teams that you can learn from, contribute to, and who will support you every step of the way!

Klick is consciously creating a culture where everyone can thrive and grow in their careers. We believe that our best work comes from our diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We strongly encourage members of historically underrepresented communities to apply, including Black people, Indigenous peoples, and other people of colour, people with disabilities, people from gender and sexually diverse communities and people with intersectional identities.

We’re also committed to developing an inclusive, barrier-free recruitment process and work environment. Should you require any accommodation, please contact us at careers@klick.com and we will work with you to meet your accessibility needs and ensure you have a positive experience.</section>",[]

We're looking for a Content Creator to lead our social media accounts and community presence.

What’s GoodGood all about?
We’re here to create a new future for local commerce, and we’re thinking big. Less selling at people, and more connecting with people. Our ultimate goal is to connect emerging makers with local neighbourhoods through authentic online and retail experiences, making their lives a little easier, a little more convenient, and a little more delightful.

GoodGood’s handpicked selection of makers reflects our community. Locally curated coffee, beverages, snacks, and everyday essentials (and okay, some non-essentials too) that are available in-store, and can be delivered to you in under an hour via our app and website? Nice.

But community is about more than just coming to you, it’s about offering a destination for discovery and connection: and that’s exactly what our neighbourhood cafés are about. Each element of the space is intentionally designed to spark curiosity. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee welcomes you, while our functional design allows communities to come together. Aspirational? Maybe. We told you we’re thinking big.

Digital storefronts via our app and website showcase our full inventory, letting guests order ahead for pick-up, or have their order delivered in under an hour. Plus, guests earn rewards via our digital loyalty program. The future of ecommerce is here, and if you ask us, it sounds GoodGood.

The Role
We're in early stages: that means you'll be GoodGood's first full-time content creator. Exciting? Yes. Daunting? That too (but we know you can handle it). You'll be responsible for defining a vision for how GoodGood can add the most value to our communities via social media. In your day-to-day, you'll work cross-functionally with multiple stakeholders, collaborating with designers, makers, and team members across the business. You'll be perfect for this role if a) your ultimate goal is to build a strong connection to our customers, b) you love a great meme, and c) your fave phrase is, ""Okay, but what if we tried...?""

Compensation: $55k - $65k with a competitive equity package - that’s right, we’re all owners here
Benefits: a) Health, b) dental, and c) vision (see what we did there?)
Workspace: Your choice: Mac or PC
Perks: Unlimited coffee and discounted snacks
Environment: Casual, fun, and creative atmosphere. Help make it what you want.

It should go without saying, but here at GoodGood, we're all about being good to people. We believe in equality, respect, inclusion, and being both a speaker and a listener when the time calls for it. We're committed to creating a safe work environment for our team members and customers, regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, ethnicity, disability, neurodiversity, religion, or any other aspect of what makes you you. Need assistance or accommodation to complete your application or during this process? Let us know.</section>",[]

We’re a small, diverse team working at the cutting edge of machine learning. At Cohere, our mission is to build machines that understand the world and to make them safely accessible to all. Language is at the crux of this, but it can be difficult and expensive to parse the syntax, semantics, and context that all work together to give words meaning. The Cohere platform provides access to Large Language Models through its APIs that read billions of web pages and learn to understand the meaning, sentiment, and intent of the words we use in a richness never seen before.

We recently raised our Series B, signed a multi-year partnership with Google Cloud, and we are focused on bringing our technology to market. We will partner with customers so they can build natural language understanding and generation into their products with just a few lines of code.

We’re ambitious — we believe our technology will fundamentally transform how industries interact with natural language. And we have the technical chops to back it up - Cohere’s CEO, Aidan Gomez, is a co-author of the groundbreaking paper “Attention is all you need”, (over 23k citations) and was previously part of Google Brain. Our entire technical team is world-class.

We are focused on creating a diverse and inclusive work environment so that all of our team members can thrive. We welcome kind and brilliant people to our team, from wherever they come.

Why this role?

As the first dedicated Visual Designer at Cohere, you will build the foundations of our journey of becoming a strong and well-known brand. This year we are embarking on a large rebrand across all fronts — digital, print, and spaces — and as our first Visual Designer, you will be scaling this in all that we do, in every way we show up.

We’re looking for a strategic designer who can tackle any visual endeavour at hand: whether it be typography, illustration, motion, or merchandise. A visionary who builds relationships, and brings everyone along to get where they need to go. We also believe that great designers are humble, curious, and well-rounded outside of design (yes, we’d like to hear about your latest two-week or six-year obsession ).

Please Note: We have offices in Toronto, Canada and Palo Alto, USA, but embrace being remote-first! We are open to candidates located in either Canada or the United States for this role.




If some of the above doesn’t line up perfectly with your experience, we still encourage you to apply! If you consider yourself a thoughtful worker, a lifelong learner, and a kind and playful team member, Cohere is the place for you.

We welcome applicants of all kinds and are committed to providing both an equal opportunity process and work environment. We value and celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive work environment for all.

Our Perks: 
 An open and inclusive culture and work environment
‍ Work closely with a team on the cutting edge of AI research
 Free daily lunch
 Full health and dental benefits for employees based in Canada and the US, including a separate budget to take care of your mental health
 100% Parental Leave top-up for 6 months for employees based in Canada and 12 weeks in the US
 Personal enrichment benefits towards arts and culture, fitness and well-being, quality time, and workspace improvement
 Remote-flexible, offices in Toronto and Palo Alto and coworking stipend
✈️ 6 weeks of vacation and shared Canada/US holidays

While on that journey, we recognize that building a startup is very hard. Turning vision into reality in a fast-growing environment takes superhuman efforts and is often one of the most difficult, yet rewarding, things one can do. Every day there are new sets of challenges to be solved at an unprecedented speed. While startups are hard, the opportunity to do career-defining work and create an economic impact, solve hard problems with incredible team members and make the world a better place, can be extremely satisfying.</p><p>While we make a conscious effort to balance hard work and personal life, we recognize that we may not be for everyone. Here are some reasons why:</p><ul><li style=""font-weight:400"">We're solving hard problems, and with that comes change, priority shifts, and iteration. If formal structure and order is what you crave, this may not be a fit.</li><li style=""font-weight:400"">Execution is everything to us. Like any hyper growth startup, we will always be resource constrained and have to do more with less. We can not let that come in the way of execution as we simply must get sh*t done. If you desire an environment with ample resources at all times, we may not be for you.</li><li style=""font-weight:400"">We move fast. Very fast. We work with tight deadlines and operate with a sense of urgency in everything we do. Sometimes we make low data choices, test and retest until we succeed, and learn from our mistakes. If you're more of a 'get it perfect the first time' person, you may not thrive in our operating style.</li><li style=""font-weight:400"">With our value of 'take extreme ownership' comes a high degree of responsibility. The phrase 'that's not my job' is not part of our vocabulary. If we put our name on something, it is on us to ensure it gets completed. That can, sometimes, mean late nights or long hours. If you're looking for a structured 40 hours/week position, this may not be the place for you. </li><li style=""font-weight:400"">ResQ operates as one team on the same path to achieve our mission. At times we have opposing views and have to disagree, and commit. There is no ego here, as we do what is best for our customers. If you're used to always getting your way, you probably won't feel comfortable with our culture. </li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>What you'll enjoy about ResQ as a Full-Time Employee: </strong></p><p><strong>We believe in taking care of each other, and here are some ways we support our team to be their best selves.</strong></p><p> </p><div><div><div><div><p><strong>Health &amp; Wellness</strong></p>●  Financial Health: Competitive compensation and stock option grants that encourage you to grow and stay at ResQ</div><div>●  No limit on paid sick days, we trust our employees to take the time they need to recover</div><div>●  Enhanced health &amp; dental benefits for you and your family that start from day one</div><div>●  Top of market parental leave to help you focus on what matters the most</div><div>●  Flex-place options that balance in-office and remote working</div><div>●  All in-office employees are fully vaccinated for COVID-19<p> </p><p><strong>Paid-time off &amp; away</strong></p>●  Yes, we have <strong>Unlimited Vacation</strong> but we recognize that many Unlimited Vacation programs have the opposite result by reducing the time employees take off.

Position: Designer, Information Design (All levels)
Reports to: Senior Director, Information Design

Role Description and Expectations

Hi there! We are looking for designers to join our Growth Design team who will craft visual presentations and long documents for business pitches. Whether seasoned in the craft or recently graduated, if you’re someone who loves all things information design, this is the job for you!

As a designer at Klick who is an expert when it comes to information design, you are a visual problem solver—you dissect complex information to simplify and abstract it. You make presentations that don’t look like presentations. You see slides as an artboard, and you are excited to convey dense information in a manner that is both visually appealing and is easily digestible for the audience.

We love passionate people and we want to see what you’re passionate about! We have created a small (completely optional) design challenge for you to show us your stuff! 

Please design a landscape sized infographic about what you love. Whether you’re passionate about sports or you’re an avid foodie that knows all the best brunch places in Toronto, we want to see this! We want to see YOU on an artboard—bonus if you do it on a powerpoint slide. If you’re up for this challenge, we would love to learn more about you via this infographic. 

Please note: All candidates must submit samples, a portfolio, or link to a personal website to be considered. Those who complete the optional design challenge will receive a call from our recruiters and feedback from one of our design leads.




Klick is consciously creating a culture where everyone can thrive and grow in their careers. We believe that our best work comes from our diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We strongly encourage members of historically underrepresented communities to apply, including Black people, Indigenous peoples, and other people of colour, people with disabilities, people from gender and sexually diverse communities and people with intersectional identities.

We’re also committed to developing an inclusive, barrier-free recruitment process and work environment. Should you require any accommodation, please contact us at careers@klick.com and we will work with you to meet your accessibility needs and ensure you have a positive experience.</section>",[]
