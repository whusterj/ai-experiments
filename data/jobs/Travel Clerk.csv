However, getting sites up and running is only the beginning. Once solar projects are built, many factors can interfere with performance. What we know from a <a href=""https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2020/10/solar-projects-are-underperforming-by-6-3-new-report-suggests-better-assessment-standards/"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">recent industry report</a> is that solar projects are underperforming by up to 6.3% on average. This number may seem inconsequential, but if these facilities continually perform shy of targets, this could interfere with private investment causing a ripple effect. Aligning financial risk and reward with low-carbon energy investments is critical for shifting the economy in the direction of reduced emissions. Without substantial private sector investment in clean energy, it will be more difficult, more costly, and more time-consuming to address climate change on a global scale.</div><div><br/></div><div>At Heliolytics, we’re working with our client partners to close that performance gap in order to enable a sustainable transition to clean energy and secure the future of our industry.
