A Port Inspection Diver must be highly dependable, self-motivated, confident, with a high-degree of self-control and emotional stability. Determination, maturity and responsibility are necessary attributes to diving candidates.

This training provides the basic core skills and knowledge common to all trades. A goal of this course is to ensure that all recruits maintain the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) physical fitness standard; as a result, a good portion of the training is physically demanding.<br><br>Port Inspection Divers attend one of the Navy’s two Fleet Diving Units located in Halifax, NS or Esquimalt, BC for six weeks of initial dive training to acquire a shallow water (15m) diving qualification that is common to all diving-related occupations/sub-occupations in the Canadian Armed Forces. This is followed by a three-week dive course which involves qualification to a depth of 30m using surface supplied air diving systems to be considered fully-trained and prepared for operational deployments.<br><br>Career progression in the Port Inspection Diving occupation involves advanced dive-related training, including:<br><ul><li>small boat and rigid hulled inflatable boat driving qualifications</li><li>qualification in explosive device recognition/identification</li><li>deep diving qualification to 45m</li><li>dive supervisor qualification to 15m</li><li>dive supervisor qualification to 45m<br></li></ul><strong>Part time options<br><br></strong>The Port Inspection Diver occupation is available for part-time employment with the Primary Reserve at certain locations across Canada.

Whether its envelope renewal, deep renovation, concrete restoration, or other building envelope management concerns, New City has the expertise and resources to handle the largest and most complex work smoothly and efficiently. Today, New City Contracting is a trusted leader in envelope renewal for commercial and residential projects.
