        <br><strong>Aperçu<br><br><br></strong>Les physiothérapeutes militaires sont chargés d’évaluer, d’instruire et de traiter le personnel militaire, ainsi que d’établir des plans de traitement pour divers troubles orthopédiques, cardiorespiratoires ou neuro-­musculo-­squelettiques et diverses blessures sportives.<br><br>À titre de membres de l’équipe des Services de santé des Forces canadiennes, les physiothérapeutes sont responsables d’évaluer les blessures et établir des plans de traitements afin de remettre les militaires sur pied avant qu’ils ne retournent sur le terrain. Ils agissent également à titre de conseillers et de guides dans les domaines suivants :<br><ul><li>Évaluation du milieu de travail et des travaux d’ergonomie industrielle;</li><li>Prévention des blessures;</li><li>Promotion de la santé;</li><li>Prévention des blessures sportives;</li><li>Formation antérieure au déploiement; et</li><li>Programmes de rééducation.</li></ul> <br><strong>Environnement de travail<br><br><br></strong>Les physiothérapeutes travaillent dans la clinique de physiothérapie située dans le centre de soins de santé ou le centre de conditionnement physique d’une base, d’une escadre ou d’une garnison. D’autres membres de l’équipe militaire des soins de santé les appuient en collaborant étroitement avec eux. Ils ont recours non seulement à des techniques de thérapie manuelle et de tissus mous, mais également à des agents physiques comme le froid, la chaleur, l’hydrothérapie, l’acupuncture et l’électrothérapie. L’équipement comprend des outils classiques comme des poids, des poulies, des appareils d’exercice, des tables de traction, des dynamomètres, des appareils fonctionnels, des fournitures orthopédiques, des orthèses et des attelles, ainsi que des dispositifs perfectionnés comme des systèmes isocinétiques-isotoniques, des tapis roulants et d’autre matériel informatisé d’exercice aérobique.<br><br>Lorsque déployés dans des unités opérationnelles, en appui aux opérations militaires à l’étranger, les physiothérapeutes peuvent travailler dans des établissements temporaires.

Cette qualification et la qualification d’officier(ère) sont requises avant toute affectation.<br><br>Études subventionnées dans un programme de maîtrise au niveau d’entrée (ES-PMNE)<br><br>Si vous avez été accepté à la maîtrise en physiothérapie dans une université canadienne reconnue et que vous réussissez votre instruction militaire, les FAC vous paieront un salaire pendant que vous faites votre maîtrise. Vous recevrez un salaire à temps plein, ce qui comprend les soins médicaux et dentaires ainsi que des vacances avec plein salaire; en retour, vous devrez travailler pour les FAC pendant un certain temps. Si vous décidez de présenter une demande dans le cadre de ce programme, vous devez prouver que vous avez été accepté sans condition à la maîtrise en physiothérapie dans une université canadienne.<br><br>Pour de plus amples renseignements, veuillez communiquer avec le recruteur spécialisé des Services de santé: HSRecruiting-RecrutementSS@forces.gc.ca<br><br><strong>Instruction<br><br></strong>Après l'enrôlement, les officiers(ères) en physiothérapie suivent la qualification militaire de base des officiers (QMBO) de 12 semaines à l’École de leadership et de recrues des Forces canadiennes de Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, au Québec. Les sujets abordés comprennent les connaissances militaires générales, les principes du leadership, les règlements et coutumes des FAC, le maniement des armes de base et les premiers soins. Vous aurez la possibilité de mettre en application les compétences militaires nouvellement acquises dans le cadre d’exercices d’entraînement portant sur la protection de la force, l’instruction appliquée, la navigation et le leadership. Vous participerez également à un programme rigoureux de sports et de conditionnement physique. Le cours de QMBO est offert en anglais ou en français et sa réussite constitue un préalable à la poursuite de l’instruction.<br><br>À la suite de la formation de base des officiers, une formation en seconde langue officielle peut vous être offerte. La formation peut durer de deux à neuf mois selon vos compétences en langue seconde.<br><br>Les officiers(ères) en physiothérapie doivent suivre le Cours commun à l’intention des officiers(ères) des Services de santé (CCOSS), un cours en ligne d’une durée de huit jours accessible sur le Réseau d’apprentissage de la Défense (RAD). Le CCOSS initie les dentistes militaires aux politiques et aux procédures des Forces armées canadiennes ainsi qu’à la gestion des ressources humaines des militaires et du personnel civil.<br><br>Les officiers(ères) en physiothérapie suivront ensuite une formation officielle de préceptorat en physiothérapie pendant environ 30 jours à la garnison de Borden, en Ontario. Cette formation fournit les connaissances de base en administration. Une instruction professionnelle spécialisée portant sur la physiothérapie exercée dans un contexte militaire est aussi offerte.<br><br>Vous pourriez avoir la possibilité d’acquérir des compétences spécialisées par l’intermédiaire de cours magistraux ou d’une formation en cours d’emploi, y compris les sujets suivants :<br><ul><li>Maintien des aptitudes cliniques</li><li>Thérapeutique manuelle</li><li>Acuponcture</li><li>Ergonomie</li><li>Biomécanique du pied et science de l’orthèse de base</li><li>Traitement des plaies et brûlures</li><li>Physiothérapie du sport<br></li></ul>À mesure qu’ils progresseront dans leur carrière, les physiothérapeutes qui manifesteront les capacités et le potentiel nécessaires pourront suivre de l’instruction avancée.

Ils sont payés durant leur instruction. Ils ne sont pas assujettis aux affectations ni aux déménagements militaires. Toutefois, ils peuvent se porter volontaires pour déménager à une autre base ou pour être déployés au Canada ou à l’étranger dans le cadre de missions militaires.<br><br>Les physiothérapeutes peuvent servir auprès de la Marine royale canadienne, de l’Armée canadienne ou de l’Aviation royale canadienne, au sein du Groupe des Services de santé des Forces canadiennes. Leur emploi consiste à évaluer, à éduquer et à traiter les membres des FAC qui sont aux prises avec des blessures et des troubles musculo-squelettiques, pour leur permettre de reprendre du service actif.

L’équipement comprend des outils classiques comme des poids, des poulies, des appareils d’exercice, des tables de traction, des dynamomètres, des appareils fonctionnels, des fournitures orthopédiques, des orthèses et des attelles, ainsi que des dispositifs perfectionnés comme des systèmes isocinétiques-isotoniques, des tapis roulants et d’autre matériel informatisé d’exercice aérobique.<br><br>Lorsque déployés dans des unités opérationnelles, en appui aux opérations militaires à l’étranger, les physiothérapeutes peuvent travailler dans des établissements temporaires. Toutefois, ils œuvrent continuellement à s’assurer que les membres des Forces armées canadiennes (FAC) demeurent prêts à combattre et appuient le travail des autres membres de l’équipe des Services de santé.<br><br><strong>Programmes d’enrôlement<br></strong><ul><li> Options d’enrôlement direct </li><li> Options d’études subventionnées <br></li></ul>Si vous êtes déjà titulaire d’un grade en physiothérapie obtenu après avoir réussi un programme autorisé au Canada et un permis d’exercice de la physiothérapie dans une province ou un territoire du Canada, les FAC pourraient vous envoyer directement à une formation en cours d’emploi après avoir obtenu votre qualification militaire de base. Cette qualification et la qualification d’officier(ère) sont requises avant toute affectation.<br><br>Études subventionnées dans un programme de maîtrise au niveau d’entrée (ES-PMNE)<br><br>Si vous avez été accepté à la maîtrise en physiothérapie dans une université canadienne reconnue et que vous réussissez votre instruction militaire, les FAC vous paieront un salaire pendant que vous faites votre maîtrise. Vous recevrez un salaire à temps plein, ce qui comprend les soins médicaux et dentaires ainsi que des vacances avec plein salaire; en retour, vous devrez travailler pour les FAC pendant un certain temps. Si vous décidez de présenter une demande dans le cadre de ce programme, vous devez prouver que vous avez été accepté sans condition à la maîtrise en physiothérapie dans une université canadienne.<br><br>Pour de plus amples renseignements, veuillez communiquer avec le recruteur spécialisé des Services de santé: HSRecruiting-RecrutementSS@forces.gc.ca<br><br><strong>Instruction<br><br></strong>Après l'enrôlement, les officiers(ères) en physiothérapie suivent la qualification militaire de base des officiers (QMBO) de 12 semaines à l’École de leadership et de recrues des Forces canadiennes de Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, au Québec. Les sujets abordés comprennent les connaissances militaires générales, les principes du leadership, les règlements et coutumes des FAC, le maniement des armes de base et les premiers soins. Vous aurez la possibilité de mettre en application les compétences militaires nouvellement acquises dans le cadre d’exercices d’entraînement portant sur la protection de la force, l’instruction appliquée, la navigation et le leadership. Vous participerez également à un programme rigoureux de sports et de conditionnement physique. Le cours de QMBO est offert en anglais ou en français et sa réussite constitue un préalable à la poursuite de l’instruction.<br><br>À la suite de la formation de base des officiers, une formation en seconde langue officielle peut vous être offerte. La formation peut durer de deux à neuf mois selon vos compétences en langue seconde.<br><br>Les officiers(ères) en physiothérapie doivent suivre le Cours commun à l’intention des officiers(ères) des Services de santé (CCOSS), un cours en ligne d’une durée de huit jours accessible sur le Réseau d’apprentissage de la Défense (RAD). Le CCOSS initie les dentistes militaires aux politiques et aux procédures des Forces armées canadiennes ainsi qu’à la gestion des ressources humaines des militaires et du personnel civil.<br><br>Les officiers(ères) en physiothérapie suivront ensuite une formation officielle de préceptorat en physiothérapie pendant environ 30 jours à la garnison de Borden, en Ontario. Cette formation fournit les connaissances de base en administration. Une instruction professionnelle spécialisée portant sur la physiothérapie exercée dans un contexte militaire est aussi offerte.<br><br>Vous pourriez avoir la possibilité d’acquérir des compétences spécialisées par l’intermédiaire de cours magistraux ou d’une formation en cours d’emploi, y compris les sujets suivants :<br><ul><li>Maintien des aptitudes cliniques</li><li>Thérapeutique manuelle</li><li>Acuponcture</li><li>Ergonomie</li><li>Biomécanique du pied et science de l’orthèse de base</li><li>Traitement des plaies et brûlures</li><li>Physiothérapie du sport<br></li></ul>À mesure qu’ils progresseront dans leur carrière, les physiothérapeutes qui manifesteront les capacités et le potentiel nécessaires pourront suivre de l’instruction avancée. Les cours suivants sont inclus :<br><ul><li>Perfectionnement en leadership des cadres intermédiaires;</li><li>Instruction en leadership; et</li><li>Formation postdoctorale.<br></li></ul><strong>Options à temps partiel<br><br></strong>Dans la plupart des cas, les officiers(ères) en physiothérapie servent dans la Force régulière. Les possibilités pour un officier(ère) en physiothérapie de servir dans la Force de réserve sont limitées.<br><br>Le rôle de la réserve des Services de santé des Forces canadiennes consiste à fournir du personnel qualifié afin de soutenir ou de joindre les organisations des Services de santé lors d’opérations des FAC et d’activités d’instruction, le tout en créant et en maintenant des liens entre les FAC et les collectivités locales.<br><br>En tant que professionnel de la santé faisant partie de la réserve des Services de santé, vous devez être titulaire d’un permis d’exercice sans restrictions dans votre domaine clinique (et des attestations requises pour votre spécialité particulière), et être en mesure de tenir vos connaissances cliniques à jour à votre lieu de travail civil.<br><br>Cette possibilité d’emploi à temps partiel est offerte auprès de la Première réserve au 1er Hôpital de campagne du Canada, situé à Ottawa. Les membres de la Force de Réserve de cette unité vivent dans différents endroits du Canada et servent à temps partiel dans une clinique militaire ou suivent une instruction militaire, au besoin, pendant un minimum de 14 jours par année. Ils sont payés durant leur instruction. Ils ne sont pas assujettis aux affectations ni aux déménagements militaires. Toutefois, ils peuvent se porter volontaires pour déménager à une autre base ou pour être déployés au Canada ou à l’étranger dans le cadre de missions militaires.<br><br>Les physiothérapeutes peuvent servir auprès de la Marine royale canadienne, de l’Armée canadienne ou de l’Aviation royale canadienne, au sein du Groupe des Services de santé des Forces canadiennes. Leur emploi consiste à évaluer, à éduquer et à traiter les membres des FAC qui sont aux prises avec des blessures et des troubles musculo-squelettiques, pour leur permettre de reprendre du service actif. Lorsqu’ils sont employés à temps partiel ou à titre d’occasionnels à temps plein, ils effectuent habituellement leur service à un endroit où œuvrent les FAC au Canada.<br><br>Les membres de la Force de réserve reçoivent le même niveau d’instruction que leurs homologues de la Force régulière. Les candidats titulaires diplômés en physiothérapie à l’issue d’un programme d’enseignement reconnu au Canada, qui détiennent un permis d’exercice de la physiothérapie délivré par une province ou un territoire au Canada et qui répondent aux critères d’adhésion à l’Association canadienne de physiothérapie, pourraient passer directement au programme d’instruction militaire requis à la suite de l’instruction de base des officiers.<br><br>Les officiers(ères) physiothérapeutes de la Force de réserve peuvent servir à temps partiel dans une clinique de services de santé et ils peuvent également effectuer leur service en occupant des postes à temps plein au sein de certaines unités pour des périodes déterminées, selon la nature des tâches à exécuter. Ils reçoivent 92,8 % du taux de rémunération de la Force régulière, ont droit à des avantages sociaux raisonnables et peuvent être admissibles à contribuer à un régime de pension.<br><br><strong>Carrières similaires<br><br></strong>Officier / Officière des sciences biologiques<br><br>Dentiste militaire<br><br>Médecin<br><br>Prime à la signature<br><br>En demande<br><br><strong>Explorez les carrières<br></strong><ul><li> Toutes les carrières </li><li> Carrières dans l’Armée de terre </li><li> Carrières dans la Marine </li><li> Carrières dans l’Aviation </li><li> Carrières dans la Force de réserve <br></li></ul><strong>S’enrôler dans<br><br>les Forces<br></strong><ul><li> Puis-je m’enrôler </li><li> Modes d’enrôlement </li><li> Étapes pour s’enrôler </li><li> Instruction de base </li><li> Programmes d’études subventionnées </li><li> Programmes à l’intention des Autochtones </li><li> Portail des postulants </li><li> Postulez maintenant <br></li></ul><strong>La vie dans les forces<br></strong><ul><li> Rémunération et avantages </li><li> Communauté </li><li> Cas de réussite <br></li></ul><strong>À propos de nous<br></strong><ul><li> Armée </li><li> Marine </li><li> Aviation </li><li> Les femmes dans les FAC <br></li></ul><strong>Prendre contact<br></strong><ul><li> Centre d'assistance </li><li> Trouvez un centre de recrutement </li><li> Évènements de recrutement </li><li> Nous joindre <br></li></ul>Modalités<br><ul><li> English<br></li></ul><strong> Emplois civils équivalents <br></strong><ul><li> Physiothérapeute</li></ul>

        <br><strong>Aperçu<br><br><br></strong>Les physiothérapeutes militaires sont chargés d’évaluer, d’instruire et de traiter le personnel militaire, ainsi que d’établir des plans de traitement pour divers troubles orthopédiques, cardiorespiratoires ou neuro-­musculo-­squelettiques et diverses blessures sportives.<br><br>À titre de membres de l’équipe des Services de santé des Forces canadiennes, les physiothérapeutes sont responsables d’évaluer les blessures et établir des plans de traitements afin de remettre les militaires sur pied avant qu’ils ne retournent sur le terrain.

D’autres membres de l’équipe militaire des soins de santé les appuient en collaborant étroitement avec eux. Ils ont recours non seulement à des techniques de thérapie manuelle et de tissus mous, mais également à des agents physiques comme le froid, la chaleur, l’hydrothérapie, l’acupuncture et l’électrothérapie. L’équipement comprend des outils classiques comme des poids, des poulies, des appareils d’exercice, des tables de traction, des dynamomètres, des appareils fonctionnels, des fournitures orthopédiques, des orthèses et des attelles, ainsi que des dispositifs perfectionnés comme des systèmes isocinétiques-isotoniques, des tapis roulants et d’autre matériel informatisé d’exercice aérobique.<br><br>Lorsque déployés dans des unités opérationnelles, en appui aux opérations militaires à l’étranger, les physiothérapeutes peuvent travailler dans des établissements temporaires. Toutefois, ils œuvrent continuellement à s’assurer que les membres des Forces armées canadiennes (FAC) demeurent prêts à combattre et appuient le travail des autres membres de l’équipe des Services de santé.<br><br><strong>Programmes d’enrôlement<br></strong><ul><li> Options d’enrôlement direct </li><li> Options d’études subventionnées <br></li></ul>Si vous êtes déjà titulaire d’un grade en physiothérapie obtenu après avoir réussi un programme autorisé au Canada et un permis d’exercice de la physiothérapie dans une province ou un territoire du Canada, les FAC pourraient vous envoyer directement à une formation en cours d’emploi après avoir obtenu votre qualification militaire de base. Cette qualification et la qualification d’officier(ère) sont requises avant toute affectation.<br><br>Études subventionnées dans un programme de maîtrise au niveau d’entrée (ES-PMNE)<br><br>Si vous avez été accepté à la maîtrise en physiothérapie dans une université canadienne reconnue et que vous réussissez votre instruction militaire, les FAC vous paieront un salaire pendant que vous faites votre maîtrise. Vous recevrez un salaire à temps plein, ce qui comprend les soins médicaux et dentaires ainsi que des vacances avec plein salaire; en retour, vous devrez travailler pour les FAC pendant un certain temps. Si vous décidez de présenter une demande dans le cadre de ce programme, vous devez prouver que vous avez été accepté sans condition à la maîtrise en physiothérapie dans une université canadienne.<br><br>Pour de plus amples renseignements, veuillez communiquer avec le recruteur spécialisé des Services de santé: HSRecruiting-RecrutementSS@forces.gc.ca<br><br><strong>Instruction<br><br></strong>Après l'enrôlement, les officiers(ères) en physiothérapie suivent la qualification militaire de base des officiers (QMBO) de 12 semaines à l’École de leadership et de recrues des Forces canadiennes de Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, au Québec. Les sujets abordés comprennent les connaissances militaires générales, les principes du leadership, les règlements et coutumes des FAC, le maniement des armes de base et les premiers soins. Vous aurez la possibilité de mettre en application les compétences militaires nouvellement acquises dans le cadre d’exercices d’entraînement portant sur la protection de la force, l’instruction appliquée, la navigation et le leadership. Vous participerez également à un programme rigoureux de sports et de conditionnement physique. Le cours de QMBO est offert en anglais ou en français et sa réussite constitue un préalable à la poursuite de l’instruction.<br><br>À la suite de la formation de base des officiers, une formation en seconde langue officielle peut vous être offerte. La formation peut durer de deux à neuf mois selon vos compétences en langue seconde.<br><br>Les officiers(ères) en physiothérapie doivent suivre le Cours commun à l’intention des officiers(ères) des Services de santé (CCOSS), un cours en ligne d’une durée de huit jours accessible sur le Réseau d’apprentissage de la Défense (RAD). Le CCOSS initie les dentistes militaires aux politiques et aux procédures des Forces armées canadiennes ainsi qu’à la gestion des ressources humaines des militaires et du personnel civil.<br><br>Les officiers(ères) en physiothérapie suivront ensuite une formation officielle de préceptorat en physiothérapie pendant environ 30 jours à la garnison de Borden, en Ontario. Cette formation fournit les connaissances de base en administration. Une instruction professionnelle spécialisée portant sur la physiothérapie exercée dans un contexte militaire est aussi offerte.<br><br>Vous pourriez avoir la possibilité d’acquérir des compétences spécialisées par l’intermédiaire de cours magistraux ou d’une formation en cours d’emploi, y compris les sujets suivants :<br><ul><li>Maintien des aptitudes cliniques</li><li>Thérapeutique manuelle</li><li>Acuponcture</li><li>Ergonomie</li><li>Biomécanique du pied et science de l’orthèse de base</li><li>Traitement des plaies et brûlures</li><li>Physiothérapie du sport<br></li></ul>À mesure qu’ils progresseront dans leur carrière, les physiothérapeutes qui manifesteront les capacités et le potentiel nécessaires pourront suivre de l’instruction avancée. Les cours suivants sont inclus :<br><ul><li>Perfectionnement en leadership des cadres intermédiaires;</li><li>Instruction en leadership; et</li><li>Formation postdoctorale.<br></li></ul><strong>Options à temps partiel<br><br></strong>Dans la plupart des cas, les officiers(ères) en physiothérapie servent dans la Force régulière. Les possibilités pour un officier(ère) en physiothérapie de servir dans la Force de réserve sont limitées.<br><br>Le rôle de la réserve des Services de santé des Forces canadiennes consiste à fournir du personnel qualifié afin de soutenir ou de joindre les organisations des Services de santé lors d’opérations des FAC et d’activités d’instruction, le tout en créant et en maintenant des liens entre les FAC et les collectivités locales.<br><br>En tant que professionnel de la santé faisant partie de la réserve des Services de santé, vous devez être titulaire d’un permis d’exercice sans restrictions dans votre domaine clinique (et des attestations requises pour votre spécialité particulière), et être en mesure de tenir vos connaissances cliniques à jour à votre lieu de travail civil.<br><br>Cette possibilité d’emploi à temps partiel est offerte auprès de la Première réserve au 1er Hôpital de campagne du Canada, situé à Ottawa. Les membres de la Force de Réserve de cette unité vivent dans différents endroits du Canada et servent à temps partiel dans une clinique militaire ou suivent une instruction militaire, au besoin, pendant un minimum de 14 jours par année. Ils sont payés durant leur instruction. Ils ne sont pas assujettis aux affectations ni aux déménagements militaires. Toutefois, ils peuvent se porter volontaires pour déménager à une autre base ou pour être déployés au Canada ou à l’étranger dans le cadre de missions militaires.<br><br>Les physiothérapeutes peuvent servir auprès de la Marine royale canadienne, de l’Armée canadienne ou de l’Aviation royale canadienne, au sein du Groupe des Services de santé des Forces canadiennes. Leur emploi consiste à évaluer, à éduquer et à traiter les membres des FAC qui sont aux prises avec des blessures et des troubles musculo-squelettiques, pour leur permettre de reprendre du service actif. Lorsqu’ils sont employés à temps partiel ou à titre d’occasionnels à temps plein, ils effectuent habituellement leur service à un endroit où œuvrent les FAC au Canada.<br><br>Les membres de la Force de réserve reçoivent le même niveau d’instruction que leurs homologues de la Force régulière.

Cette qualification et la qualification d’officier(ère) sont requises avant toute affectation.<br><br>Études subventionnées dans un programme de maîtrise au niveau d’entrée (ES-PMNE)<br><br>Si vous avez été accepté à la maîtrise en physiothérapie dans une université canadienne reconnue et que vous réussissez votre instruction militaire, les FAC vous paieront un salaire pendant que vous faites votre maîtrise. Vous recevrez un salaire à temps plein, ce qui comprend les soins médicaux et dentaires ainsi que des vacances avec plein salaire; en retour, vous devrez travailler pour les FAC pendant un certain temps. Si vous décidez de présenter une demande dans le cadre de ce programme, vous devez prouver que vous avez été accepté sans condition à la maîtrise en physiothérapie dans une université canadienne.<br><br>Pour de plus amples renseignements, veuillez communiquer avec le recruteur spécialisé des Services de santé: HSRecruiting-RecrutementSS@forces.gc.ca<br><br><strong>Instruction<br><br></strong>Après l'enrôlement, les officiers(ères) en physiothérapie suivent la qualification militaire de base des officiers (QMBO) de 12 semaines à l’École de leadership et de recrues des Forces canadiennes de Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, au Québec. Les sujets abordés comprennent les connaissances militaires générales, les principes du leadership, les règlements et coutumes des FAC, le maniement des armes de base et les premiers soins. Vous aurez la possibilité de mettre en application les compétences militaires nouvellement acquises dans le cadre d’exercices d’entraînement portant sur la protection de la force, l’instruction appliquée, la navigation et le leadership. Vous participerez également à un programme rigoureux de sports et de conditionnement physique. Le cours de QMBO est offert en anglais ou en français et sa réussite constitue un préalable à la poursuite de l’instruction.<br><br>À la suite de la formation de base des officiers, une formation en seconde langue officielle peut vous être offerte. La formation peut durer de deux à neuf mois selon vos compétences en langue seconde.<br><br>Les officiers(ères) en physiothérapie doivent suivre le Cours commun à l’intention des officiers(ères) des Services de santé (CCOSS), un cours en ligne d’une durée de huit jours accessible sur le Réseau d’apprentissage de la Défense (RAD). Le CCOSS initie les dentistes militaires aux politiques et aux procédures des Forces armées canadiennes ainsi qu’à la gestion des ressources humaines des militaires et du personnel civil.<br><br>Les officiers(ères) en physiothérapie suivront ensuite une formation officielle de préceptorat en physiothérapie pendant environ 30 jours à la garnison de Borden, en Ontario. Cette formation fournit les connaissances de base en administration. Une instruction professionnelle spécialisée portant sur la physiothérapie exercée dans un contexte militaire est aussi offerte.<br><br>Vous pourriez avoir la possibilité d’acquérir des compétences spécialisées par l’intermédiaire de cours magistraux ou d’une formation en cours d’emploi, y compris les sujets suivants :<br><ul><li>Maintien des aptitudes cliniques</li><li>Thérapeutique manuelle</li><li>Acuponcture</li><li>Ergonomie</li><li>Biomécanique du pied et science de l’orthèse de base</li><li>Traitement des plaies et brûlures</li><li>Physiothérapie du sport<br></li></ul>À mesure qu’ils progresseront dans leur carrière, les physiothérapeutes qui manifesteront les capacités et le potentiel nécessaires pourront suivre de l’instruction avancée.

Les possibilités pour un officier(ère) en physiothérapie de servir dans la Force de réserve sont limitées.<br><br>Le rôle de la réserve des Services de santé des Forces canadiennes consiste à fournir du personnel qualifié afin de soutenir ou de joindre les organisations des Services de santé lors d’opérations des FAC et d’activités d’instruction, le tout en créant et en maintenant des liens entre les FAC et les collectivités locales.<br><br>En tant que professionnel de la santé faisant partie de la réserve des Services de santé, vous devez être titulaire d’un permis d’exercice sans restrictions dans votre domaine clinique (et des attestations requises pour votre spécialité particulière), et être en mesure de tenir vos connaissances cliniques à jour à votre lieu de travail civil.<br><br>Cette possibilité d’emploi à temps partiel est offerte auprès de la Première réserve au 1er Hôpital de campagne du Canada, situé à Ottawa. Les membres de la Force de Réserve de cette unité vivent dans différents endroits du Canada et servent à temps partiel dans une clinique militaire ou suivent une instruction militaire, au besoin, pendant un minimum de 14 jours par année. Ils sont payés durant leur instruction. Ils ne sont pas assujettis aux affectations ni aux déménagements militaires. Toutefois, ils peuvent se porter volontaires pour déménager à une autre base ou pour être déployés au Canada ou à l’étranger dans le cadre de missions militaires.<br><br>Les physiothérapeutes peuvent servir auprès de la Marine royale canadienne, de l’Armée canadienne ou de l’Aviation royale canadienne, au sein du Groupe des Services de santé des Forces canadiennes. Leur emploi consiste à évaluer, à éduquer et à traiter les membres des FAC qui sont aux prises avec des blessures et des troubles musculo-squelettiques, pour leur permettre de reprendre du service actif.
