<p>The Protection for Persons in Care Unit investigates reports of abuse in publicly funded facilities and administers the Protection for Persons in Care Act (Act). This Act promotes the safety and well-being of adult Albertans who receive care or support services from publicly funded service providers.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/> </p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Role</b></h2>
</div>
<div>
<p> Are you a Registered Nurse who is ready to take your clinical experience to the next step? Do you have an eye for reviewing investigation findings to assess if persons in care are treated with the respect and safety that complies with legislated terms? If so, this opportunity may be right for you.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p>The Public Health and Compliance Division is looking for a Complaints Officer (Registered Nurse) to join the Protection of Persons in Care (PCC) Unit. As a Complaints Officer, you support the non-biased, independent review of alleged reports of abuse. You maintain communication with complainants; manage the intake phone line; and review, analyze, synthesize, and provide written advice on information gathered by a contracted investigator. You administer the Protection for Persons in Care Act (PPCA) through your analysis of (1) the contracted investigator’s report, (2) medical documentation, and (3) your expert knowledge, assessment, and application of clinical Nursing experience. You complete your review with a summarized report and recommendation regarding compliance with the PPCA.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p>You are a direct contact for key stakeholders, including complainants. You manage the intake phone line that Albertan’s may use to report allegations of abuse. You complete an inquiry process to obtain and review personal, health and financial information from complainants to determine if there is a need for an investigation. If an investigation is required, you appoint an external contracted investigator to conduct the investigation. You communicate directly with Albertan’s who may be personally/emotionally invested in the outcomes of your review. As your role determines if the allegation meets the jurisdiction of the PPCA, your client-service and issues management skills are critical. As you share information that may have personal/emotional impacts, you are strong at de-escalating conversations and understanding the realities in which your role operates.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p>Your education and clinical experience as a Registered Nurse is critical in reviewing reports and analyzing medical information in cases involving alleged abuse. Your knowledge of the health care system, including homecare, long-term care, lodges, hospitals, and/or mental health facilities is essential. You incorporate theory, clinical knowledge and your understanding of the health system when reviewing reports of abuse. You independently review/analyze medical reports, diagnostic and lab results, medical orders, client care plans, and assessments from physicians and other health care professionals, caregivers, service providers and program areas, such as Persons with Developmental Disabilities.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p>You synthesize information from various sources and review adherence to the PPCA and related required legislations. You play an essential role in providing advice to the Statutory Director in making a decision on the outcome of an investigation, approving investigator recommendations, providing direction to service providers in preventing future incidents of abuse, and in reviewing service provider’s responses to ensure compliance with the director’s decision. Your exceptional comprehension, critical analysis, and written and verbal communication skills are key in documenting investigation findings, writing summary reports and relaying analysis outcomes, lessons learned, and for documenting and sharing improved practices with the team. You are able to translate the PPCA, medical terminology and related technical information into simple, clear language to help transfer knowledge and understanding to stakeholders and your team.<br/> </p>

<b> Trillium Health Partners - Institute for Better Health</b>
</div>
<div>
    Trillium Health Partners' (THP) Strategic Plan has identified research as a key priority for achieving its vision of delivering a new kind of health care for a healthier community and the Institute for Better Health (IBH) was created to support this vision. The IBH creates diverse and meaningful partnerships within and beyond Trillium Health Partners with the aim of improving the health of our community. Through this, IBH supports a diverse spectrum of research across THP, including biomedical, clinical, population health, health services and educational research, as well as leads research focused on population health and improving health services. THPs mission of creating a new kind of health care for a healthier community is enabled by strategic research partnerships and collaboration of health researchers. That is why we are seeking a talented Research Associate to join our Better Together team.
  </div>
<div></div>
<div>
<b><br/> The Role</b>
</div>
<div>
    The Research Associate role within the IBH supports research studies and initiatives across the organization and within the community. Through this role the successful candidate will support the Family and Child Health Initiative (FCHI) (https://familyandchildhealth.ca) to lead the first phase of first phase of a Canadian Institutes of Health (CIHR) – funded data innovation project entitled, “Building CAPACIty for pediatric diabetes research and quality improvement across Canada.”
  </div>
<div></div>
<div>
<b><br/> Project Description</b>
</div>
<div>
    Diabetes in one of the most common lifelong childhood disorders that affects ~40,000 children and youth in Canada. Research shows that even with new technology and drugs, children and youth living with diabetes are still not meeting recommended treatment targets. For example, their blood sugar control is poor, and they are more likely to have lower quality of life and develop other health problems such as heart or kidney disease. This is in part due to poor access to diabetes healthcare, which is worse in disadvantaged populations across Canada. We will develop strategies to address these gaps: The CAnadian PediAtric diabetes ConstortIum (CAPACIty) is a network of 10 childhood diabetes centres from across Canada, and their doctors and researchers who specialize in childhood diabetes. We will partner with patients/families and healthcare professionals to jointly design a Canada-wide childhood diabetes registry that will support improvements in clinical care, advance research, and inspire action by policymakers like improving coverage of diabetes technology and expanding support for diabetes in school. We will: (1) create an Advisory Board that will guide all aspects of the project and will include people living with/caring for a child with diabetes, health care professionals, researchers, and policymakers; (2) design and implement, in partnership with the Advisory Board, a childhood diabetes registry and quality improvement initiative called ‘audit &amp; feedback’ where key clinical measures, that matter most to patients and families, are compared between Canadian diabetes centres; and (3) evaluate how this registry and audit &amp; feedback initiative inform action across all parts of the system including healthcare, research, policy and education. We are unique because we will focus on measuring indicators of inequality so that our strategies will positively impact the most disadvantaged children and youth living with diabetes, and their families.

It has been located on its Glenside Road property since 1969. The current Christian Education (CE) building served as the meeting place until 1981, when the current larger building was completed, and has been our meeting place for 40 years now. Arrowsmith is affiliated with the Baptist Conference of British Columbia and the Baptist General Conference of Canada. There have been roughly 6 full time pastors during Arrowsmith’s lifespan, most recently the Reverend Doctor Leland Botzet, who led us from 2007-2020. Our mission statement is that “we seek to passionately proclaim the glory of God in Christ for the joy of all people”. At ABC we value God Himself, His word, and worshipping him together in a variety of ways. Arrowsmith has been involved in two church plants, Hammond Bay Baptist in Nanaimo, and Friendship Baptist in Saanich. Our vision for our church is to see God glorified, the good news of the gospel shared to a community that desperately needs it and to see God’s Kingdom grow here in Port Alberni. We also desire to have God’s people grow deeper in their obedience and mature in their walk with him. We would like to be more effective in community outreach.</p><p><b>Part Two—Lead Pastor Position at ABC</b></p><p>The position of Lead Pastor at ABC entails leadership of the staff and congregation, as well as church life in general. The Lead Pastor is the chief elder, or “first among equals”. Preaching and teaching are critically important, as they facilitate training for ministry work, and discipleship of the body at ABC. The Lead pastor will steer the church in vision, mission and direction. Regular pastoral care of Arrowsmith’s church family in various ways is vital.</p><p>In terms of day-to-day duties, prayer is foremost. Also, office time will foster increased connection with staff, as well as clear management of the week’s activities. Study for sermon preparation will be necessary. The lead pastor will have time for planning the short term and long-term vision of the church. There will be various meetings, with leaders and the congregation. At some points there will also be evening, or after-hours connections and meetings. On the weekend, the Lead Pastor will give leadership and overall direction to worship services. Prayer before the service, and availability after the service will be important. In terms of training and leading volunteer teams, the lead pastor will be expected to participate in varying degrees in all facets of Arrowsmith ministries.</p><p><b>Part Three—Qualifications </b></p><p>The successful candidate must have at least a Bachelor’s level of education, or the equivalent of combined courses of study. A Master’s level of education is preferred, but there may also be an opportunity to pursue this while employed in the role of Lead pastor. The candidate’s education should be in a theological discipline, or divinity or Biblical studies. The education must be from a reputable institution that is approved by the BCBC, and\or ABC.</p><p>Previous ministry experience may be informal or formal in nature, as well as vocational or non-vocational. The successful candidate will have at least 5 years of relevant experience in relevant areas. The candidate will have varied experience (not solely related to church life) in leading staff and volunteers. The candidate will also need communication skills in the areas of teaching and inter-personal relations. The new lead pastor of ABC will also possess a high comfort level in operating online and with technological aspects of communication and multi-media.</p><p>Four critical areas of strength are biblical preaching, a relational approach to evangelism and discipleship, leadership in vision/planning/implementation, and finally, possessing a solid 1 Timothy 3 character in all facets of life.</p><p><b>Part 4—The Community of the Alberni Valley </b></p><p>Port Alberni, the gateway to the west coast, and the “salmon capital of the world”, is in the Alberni Valley on Vancouver Island on the west coast of British Columbia Canada. It has a mild, temperate, and sometimes very wet rainforest climate. It is considered mid-island, or even inland, or west coast on Vancouver Island. As such, it is located relatively equally between the larger centres of the Comox Valley, up-island, and Nanaimo down-island. Within 1-2 hours of driving, you can be in the Comox Valley, or Nanaimo, or the beautiful west coast, including Tofino and Ucluelet. Port Alberni is located at the head of the Alberni Inlet, the only deep-water port on the west side of Vancouver Island. The population of the city is approximately 18,000, while the greater region has roughly 31,000 people. The Alberni Valley has a diverse population, including about 15% of the population being Indigenous.</p><p>Compared to Vancouver Island as a whole, Port Alberni has affordable housing as well as a wide range of amenities including West Coast General Hospital in the centre of town. There is fishing, hiking, and many other outdoor activities, including gorgeous Sproat Lake and Great Central Lake. Mount Washington for skiing, mountain biking and other activities is only 1.5 hours driving away. There is a large sporting community in Port Alberni with many excellent facilities, including the hockey arena, home to a Junior A, and Junior B hockey team. Additionally, there is a swimming pool, Gymastics academy, Athletic Hall, and Bob Dailey Stadium (track and field). Historically, Port Alberni was a logging and fishing town, but it is rapidly diversifying into small business and tourism. There are two very large development projects on the horizon, one being a gentrification of the former industrial waterfront, and a proposed 1-billion-dollar housing project with projected 3000 units of mixed variety, creating 4000 jobs over ten years.</p><p>Port Alberni is located in School District 70, Pacific Rim, and has an excellent system of elementary schools which lead into Alberni District Secondary, a state-of-the-art high school that has been operating since 2012, and which boasts a huge range of educational and extra-curricular activities. There is also a strong network of homeschoolers, and the private school John Paul II (k-8 school).

172,Lead Pastor,Baptist General Conference of Canada,"Port Alberni, BC",https://ca.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=b230be5e9871040c&fccid=c2d21c7ad76bbcac&vjs=3,"<div class=""jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"" id=""jobDescriptionText""><p></p><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><b>The Story of Arrowsmith Baptist Church</b>:</p><p>
Arrowsmith has been a Baptist church in Port Alberni since 1965. It has been located on its Glenside Road property since 1969. The current Christian Education (CE) building served as the meeting place until 1981, when the current larger building was completed, and has been our meeting place for 40 years now. Arrowsmith is affiliated with the Baptist Conference of British Columbia and the Baptist General Conference of Canada. There have been roughly 6 full time pastors during Arrowsmith’s lifespan, most recently the Reverend Doctor Leland Botzet, who led us from 2007-2020. Our mission statement is that “we seek to passionately proclaim the glory of God in Christ for the joy of all people”. At ABC we value God Himself, His word, and worshipping him together in a variety of ways. Arrowsmith has been involved in two church plants, Hammond Bay Baptist in Nanaimo, and Friendship Baptist in Saanich. Our vision for our church is to see God glorified, the good news of the gospel shared to a community that desperately needs it and to see God’s Kingdom grow here in Port Alberni. We also desire to have God’s people grow deeper in their obedience and mature in their walk with him. We would like to be more effective in community outreach.</p><p><b>
Lead Pastor Position at Arrowsmith Baptist Church:</b></p><p>
The position of Lead Pastor at ABC entails leadership of the staff and congregation, as well as church life in general. The Lead Pastor is the chief elder, or “first among equals”. Preaching and teaching are critically important, as they facilitate training for ministry work, and discipleship of the body at ABC. The Lead pastor will steer the church in vision, mission and direction. Regular pastoral care of Arrowsmith’s church family in various ways is vital.</p><p>
In terms of day-to-day duties, prayer is foremost. Also, office time will foster increased connection with staff, as well as clear management of the week’s activities. Study for sermon preparation will be necessary. The lead pastor will have time for planning the short term and long-term vision of the church. There will be various meetings, with leaders and the congregation. At some points there will also be evening, or after-hours connections and meetings. On the weekend, the Lead Pastor will give leadership and overall direction to worship services. Prayer before the service, and availability after the service will be important. In terms of training and leading volunteer teams, the lead pastor will be expected to participate in varying degrees in all facets of Arrowsmith ministries.</p><p><b>
Qualifications:</b></p><p>
The successful candidate must have at least a Bachelor’s level of education, or the equivalent of combined courses of study. A Master’s level of education is preferred, but there may also be an opportunity to pursue this while employed in the role of Lead pastor. The candidate’s education should be in a theological discipline, or divinity or Biblical studies. The education must be from a reputable institution that is approved by the BCBC, and\or ABC.</p><p>
Previous ministry experience may be informal or formal in nature, as well as vocational or nonvocational. The successful candidate will have at least 5 years of relevant experience in relevant areas. The candidate will have varied experience (not solely related to church life) in leading staff and volunteers. The candidate will also need communication skills in the areas of teaching and inter-personal relations. The new lead pastor of ABC will also possess a high comfort level in operating online and with technological aspects of communication and multi-media.</p><p>
Four critical areas of strength are biblical preaching, a relational approach to evangelism and discipleship, leadership in vision/planning/implementation, and finally, possessing a solid 1 Timothy 3 character in all facets of life.</p><p><b>
The Community of the Alberni Valley:</b></p><p>
Port Alberni, the gateway to the west coast, and the “salmon capital of the world”, is in the Alberni Valley on Vancouver Island on the west coast of British Columbia Canada. It has a mild, temperate, and sometimes very wet rainforest climate. It is considered mid-island, or even inland, or west coast on Vancouver Island. As such, it is located relatively equally between the larger centres of the Comox Valley, up-island, and Nanaimo down-island. Within 1-2 hours of driving, you can be in the Comox Valley, or Nanaimo, or the beautiful west coast, including Tofino and Ucluelet. Port Alberni is located at the head of the Alberni Inlet, the only deep-water port on the west side of Vancouver Island. The population of the city is approximately 18,000, while the greater region has roughly 31,000 people. The Alberni Valley has a diverse population, including about 15% of the population being Indigenous.</p><p>
Compared to Vancouver Island as a whole, Port Alberni has affordable housing as well as a wide range of amenities including West Coast General Hospital in the centre of town. There is fishing, hiking, and many other outdoor activities, including gorgeous Sproat Lake and Great Central Lake. Mount Washington for skiing, mountain biking and other activities is only 1.5 hours driving away. There is a large sporting community in Port Alberni with many excellent facilities, including the hockey arena, home to a Junior A, and Junior B hockey team. Additionally, there is a swimming pool, Gymastics academy, Athletic Hall, and Bob Dailey Stadium (track and field). Historically, Port Alberni was a logging and fishing town, but it is rapidly diversifying into small business and tourism. There are two very large development projects on the horizon, one being a gentrification of the former industrial waterfront, and a proposed 1-billion-dollar housing project with projected 3000 units of mixed variety, creating 4000 jobs over ten years.</p><p>
Port Alberni is located in School District 70, Pacific Rim, and has an excellent system of elementary schools which lead into Alberni District Secondary, a state-of-the-art high school that has been operating since 2012, and which boasts a huge range of educational and extracurricular activities. There is also a strong network of homeschoolers, and the private school John Paul II (k-8 school). In addition, North Island College has two campuses in Port Alberni.</p><p>
