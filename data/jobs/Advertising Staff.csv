The Board of Directors of Dom Lipa is seeking to fill the role of Campaign Director to lead a new capital fundraising campaign. <br/><br/><strong>Background on Dom Lipa</strong><br/>Dom Lipa fosters a caring Catholic environment offering traditional foods and cultural programming. The facility was built over 30 years ago through the private fundraising efforts of the Slovenian community in the Toronto area to provide the highest quality of resident care to meet the changing needs of our aging community. Dom Lipa is a progressive organization that is well managed and connected with the cultural community. Resident satisfaction rates are very high and Dom Lipa has been recognized by the community and government for its excellent response to the pandemic and for keeping the residents safe. The majority of funding for Long Term Care operating costs comes from government sources and the retirement side is predominantly funded by rental income. As well, many volunteer activities support the charitable not-for-profit home. <br/><br/><strong>Background on the need for the Capital Fundraising Campaign</strong><br/>As a government-funded Long Term Care home, Dom Lipa is currently pursuing an application for additional class A licenses and redevelopment of the home to better utilize existing space. Dom Lipa will maintain the 30 retirement units to facilitate a continuum of care and spousal unification when one spouse does not require long-term care placement. Dom Lipa is developing a capital fundraising campaign. Although significant funds are expected from government sources, Dom Lipa and its community will also be expected to contribute to the retirement portion of the redevelopment cost which is not eligible under the Long Term Care program. Regardless of the decisions by the Ministry, it is our intent to upgrade the whole building to address repairs and required standards. <br/><br/><strong>Job Function: </strong><br/>With advice from relevant consultant experts, the Campaign Director will plan and develop the campaign, lead its implementation, and provide ongoing reporting to the Board of Directors. The Director will be a champion for Dom Lipa, bringing enthusiasm and energy to the role, and be organized and results-oriented. This individual will be credible and lead the campaign with professionalism and diplomacy. In addition, this individual will work closely with other team members and volunteers conducting fundraising activities. <br/><br/><strong>Qualifications: </strong><br/><em>The ideal qualifications of the preferred candidate are outlined below.</em></div><ul><li>College or university degree, in marketing or health care sector or relevant equivalent.</li><li>Minimum 2 years experience of effective management experience.</li><li>Demonstrated experience in relationship management and collaboration skills with experience in communicating with constituents by way of written newsletters, oral presentations, etc.</li><li>Experience working on large projects.</li><li>Experience working with volunteers.</li><li>Self-directed with strong planning, time-management, results-oriented and organizational skills.</li><li>Knowledge of the Slovenian community in the GTA is an 'asset', and basic ability to communicate in Slovenian is preferred but not a requirement.</li></ul><div><br/><strong>Other: </strong><br/>This position is a part-time role for the duration of the campaign, expected to last between approximately 3 – 5 years, and is compensated commensurate to similar roles in the community charity sector.</div></section>","['Self-directed with strong planning, time-management, results-oriented and organizational skills.', 'Experience working with volunteers.', 'Experience working on large projects.', 'College or university degree, in marketing or health care sector or relevant equivalent.', 'Demonstrated experience in relationship management and collaboration skills with experience in communicating with constituents by way of written newsletters, oral presentations, etc.', ""Knowledge of the Slovenian community in the GTA is an 'asset', and basic ability to communicate in Slovenian is preferred but not a requirement."", 'Minimum 2 years experience of effective management experience.']"

The work involves driving toward results by enrolling the commitment and buy-in of others. While the job requires strong initiative and self-direction, results are only achieved with and through people. A sincere appreciation for people and how they are each uniquely motivated is the foundation for designing and implementing interactive communication and decision-making processes. Knowledge and skill in how to successfully influence and persuade others by understanding how their individual needs and<br/>motivations link to goals are essential. The job requires a high degree of “selling”, whether of ideas and policies within the organization, or products or services in the marketplace. The job environment is fast-paced and results-oriented. While there is urgency to goal achievement, responsibility for the achievement of results needs to be shared and effectively delegated when necessary. Initiating projects and processes beyond established organization practices will often require training and developing others, and enlisting their support by using a “selling” rather “telling” communication style. A self-confident, extroverted style that can enliven, engage and positively impact individuals and groups is essential. The job has a variety of tasks and is dynamic and changing. Because goals and desired results can quickly change, the job requires regularly meeting and pro-actively establishing relationships with new groups. The ability to understand, quickly react, and motivate others to adapt to the changing organization environment is a critical key to success. In general, the core of this position requires a motivated and motivating team builder and organization developer.</p><p><strong>Job Characteristics</strong> <br/>Variety of activities Multiple projects occurring simultaneously Multi-tasking Sense of urgency for goal<br/>achievement Fast-paced environment<br/>People/relationships focus Team building Inspire, motivate others, and engage their commitment<br/>Involve others in decision-making process Cooperative, collaborative decision-making Must assume<br/>responsibility for risk<br/>Extroverted, warm, enthusiastic, empathetic Stimulating communicator Persuasive “selling” style<br/>Collaborative approach<br/>Leadership is based on the ability to motivate others<br/>Strong commitment to results<br/>Delegate authority readily</p><p>Training provided for the licensed candidate.

We are paving the path for access to future solutions like the connected home, smart cities, and our Health applications.<br/>

1. Door Warming. You will meet our potential customers at their homes to deliver messaging, provide education, and create awareness of the PureFibre network being built in their community. A major component to this role is collecting leads of interested potential customers who wish to be contacted once PureFibre is available. This role does not include sales, but an opportunity to inform the public about our products &amp; services.<br/><br/>
2. Local Experiential Marketing Events (when applicable). This role will also speak to current and potential customers about our products and services at events where applicable.

For Door Warming: you will engage in conversations with anyone who opens the door, following the direction given for that type of door warming, answering any questions and generally getting prospects excited about PureFibre.<br/><br/>
While this role is not selling, you will be asked to collect information when there is either strong interest in a product or frustration so the appropriate teams can follow up.<br/><br/>
At events: supporting the local Regional Market Manager to assist with setting up table or booth in accordance with brand standards. Throughout the event, engage with event attendees, actively promoting products &amp; services, and if applicable contesting. Post event, help break down the table/tent and return all materials as arranged with Regional Market Manager.<br/><br/>

THE OPPORTUNITY<br/><br/>
You will be joining a high performing team, passionate and dedicated to delivering on a world-class fibre optic network that will ensure speed and capacity for generations to come.<br/><br/>
We are paving the path for access to future solutions like the connected home, smart cities, and our Health applications.<br/>
Our PureFibre network, the #1 internet technology for speed and reliability, enables faster sharing, steadier streaming, clearer video chats and smoother gaming.<br/>
Our team is responsible for sharing the PureFibre message in communities across Alberta and British Columbia.<br/><br/>
We are seeking creative, flexible and outgoing individuals who have a propensity for turning challenges into opportunities.<br/>
This role will support the PureFibre in-field marketing teams, focusing specifically on event based and door to door promotional activities.<br/><br/>
ABOUT THE ROLE<br/><br/>
The PureFibre team is currently seeking mature individuals to fill Brand Ambassador Positions on a 1 year contract.<br/>
Successful individuals will take ownership and deliver on objectives through two types of onsite support:<br/><br/>
1. Door Warming. You will meet our potential customers at their homes to deliver messaging, provide education, and create awareness of the PureFibre network being built in their community. A major component to this role is collecting leads of interested potential customers who wish to be contacted once PureFibre is available. This role does not include sales, but an opportunity to inform the public about our products &amp; services.<br/><br/>
2. Local Experiential Marketing Events (when applicable). This role will also speak to current and potential customers about our products and services at events where applicable. This will include event set-up, tear down, and supporting a Regional Market Manager, or other internal organizations as the event progresses.<br/><br/>
Transportation: This role requires access to a vehicle. It must be available to you at all times. As location will vary per event, sometimes including multiple locations per shift, candidate will need to be able to have transportation to drive to different locations within their city, and will be reimbursed mileage over and above what they would normally drive to their nearest office.<br/><br/>
Hours: A successful candidate can look forward to 0-37.5 hours per week based on current in-field campaigns and initiatives, aligned with their availability.<br/><br/>
Responsibilities: The successful candidates for this role will attend events and/or door warming to deliver messaging and gifting. This will include: - Picking up required collateral, swag, gifts or event equipment as required. Materials may also be shipped to your house, prior to engagement.<br/><br/>
For Door Warming: you will engage in conversations with anyone who opens the door, following the direction given for that type of door warming, answering any questions and generally getting prospects excited about PureFibre.<br/><br/>
While this role is not selling, you will be asked to collect information when there is either strong interest in a product or frustration so the appropriate teams can follow up.<br/><br/>
At events: supporting the local Regional Market Manager to assist with setting up table or booth in accordance with brand standards. Throughout the event, engage with event attendees, actively promoting products &amp; services, and if applicable contesting. Post event, help break down the table/tent and return all materials as arranged with Regional Market Manager.<br/><br/>
Required Skills &amp; Abilities:<br/>
• Passionate about outstanding customer service and sales<br/>
• Passionate for technology<br/>
• Motivated to meet campaign KPI's and goals<br/>
• Self-starter, intrinsic motivations<br/>
• Excellent communication (written, verbal) skills<br/>
• Desire to ""roll up your sleeves"" to get things done<br/>
• Flexibility to work outside of a 9-5pm role if necessary Required Professional Designation/Certification:<br/>
• High school completion<br/>
• Some post-Secondary education (i.e. Marketing, Sales) (if you are interested in growing your skills in marketing, business discussions, or sales this is a great introductory role for you)<br/><br/>
Required Experience: • You have a passion for events, sales and customer service. You have experience in one of these fields, or are looking to grow in experience.</section>",[]

It’s the only place where we can fully understand the what the meaning of “cold” really is, and it’s why we do what we do. But it’s not for everyone. Some call the Arctic landscape relentless. Dark, dangerous and uninviting. We call it home. It’s also home to the people of the North – the foremost experts in cold. Just as the Italians know knits and the British know wool, northern communities know parkas. Like us, they embrace living off the land and have a strong and meaningful respect for nature. We honour them, never losing sight of the wisdom we can learn from their patience, resilience and deep connection to all that surrounds them.</p><p><strong>Our Purpose - We inspire and enable all people to engage with the outside world.</strong></p><p>At Canada Goose, nature is our North Star. We aren’t simply linked to nature – we’re guided and inspired by it. Our connection to the environment compels us to design functionally superior products so people can immerse themselves in the outside world. Our first parkas were made for northerners, those living in the coldest places on Earth. Today, our products continue to be designed for the extreme outdoors, but they’ve also been adapted for all aspects of modern life – past the four walls that shelter us and beyond our everyday experiences. Whether you’re crossing the rugged terrain of Antarctica or commuting in rush-hour during a downpour, we endure any extreme, observe every detail, and take the long view to make clothing that enables everyone to live out there, wherever “out there” is for them.</p><p><strong>Our Core Belief - Greatness Is Out There</strong></p><p>Canada Goose is more than a company that makes best-in-class outerwear. We’re a community that’s propelled forward by one core belief: greatness. Greatness has driven us to where we are today, and it’s always been at the heart of Canada Goose. It’s a journey, not a destination. Whether that means honouring traditional methods of craftsmanship, supporting explorers around the globe, or enabling people to discover more about the world, we’re moving towards something bigger than ourselves.

You will be joining a high performing team, passionate and dedicated to delivering on our client's #1 strategic investment – a world-class fibre optic network that will ensure speed and capacity for generations to come.<br/><br/>
Description:<br/><br/>
We are paving the path for access to future solutions like the connected home, smart cities, and our Health applications.<br/><br/>
Our PureFibre network, the #1 internet technology for speed and reliability, enables faster sharing, steadier streaming, clearer video chats and smoother gaming.<br/><br/>
Our team is responsible for sharing the PureFibre message in communities across Alberta and British Columbia.<br/><br/>
We are seeking creative, flexible and outgoing individuals who have a propensity for turning challenges into opportunities.<br/><br/>
This role will support the PureFibre in-field marketing teams, focusing specifically on event based and door to door promotional activities.<br/><br/>
ABOUT THE ROLE<br/><br/>
The PureFibre team is currently seeking mature individuals to fill Brand Ambassador Positions on a 1 year contract.<br/><br/>
Successful individuals will take ownership and deliver on objectives through two types of onsite support:<br/><br/>
1. Door Warming. You will meet our potential customers at their homes to deliver messaging, provide education, and create awareness of the PureFibre network being built in their community. A major component to this role is collecting leads of interested potential customers who wish to be contacted once PureFibre is available. This role does not include sales, but an opportunity to inform the public about our products &amp; services.<br/><br/>
2. Local Experiential Marketing Events (when applicable). This role will also speak to current and potential customers about our products and services at events where applicable. This will include event set-up, tear down, and supporting a Regional Market Manager, or other internal organizations as the event progresses.<br/><br/>
Transportation: This role requires access to a vehicle. It must be available to you at all times. As location will vary per event, sometimes including multiple locations per shift, candidate will need to be able to have transportation to drive to different locations within their city, and will be reimbursed mileage over and above what they would normally drive to their nearest office.<br/><br/>
Hours: A successful candidate can look forward to 0-37.5 hours per week based on current in-field campaigns and initiatives, aligned with their availability.<br/><br/>
Responsibilities: The successful candidates for this role will attend events and/or door warming to deliver messaging and gifting. This will include: - Picking up required collateral, swag, gifts or event equipment as required. Materials may also be shipped to your house, prior to engagement.<br/><br/>
For Door Warming: you will engage in conversations with anyone who opens the door, following the direction given for that type of door warming, answering any questions and generally getting prospects excited about PureFibre and the company.<br/><br/>
While this role is not selling, you will be asked to collect information when there is either strong interest in a product or frustration towards the company so the appropriate teams can follow up.<br/><br/>
At events: supporting the local Regional Market Manager to assist with setting up table or booth in accordance with brand standards. Throughout the event, engage with event attendees, actively promoting products &amp; services, and if applicable contesting. Post event, help break down the table/tent and return all materials as arranged with Regional Market Manager.<br/><br/>
Required Skills &amp; Abilities:<br/>
• Passionate about outstanding customer service and sales<br/>
• Passionate for technology<br/>
• Motivated to meet campaign KPI's and goals<br/>
• Self-starter, intrinsic motivations<br/>
• Excellent communication (written, verbal) skills<br/>
• Desire to ""roll up your sleeves"" to get things done<br/>
• Flexibility to work outside of a 9-5pm role if necessary Required Professional Designation/Certification:<br/>
• High school completion<br/>
