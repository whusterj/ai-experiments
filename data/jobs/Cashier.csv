As per the Policy on COVID-19 Vaccination for Parks Canada Agency, employees must attest to their vaccination status. The requirement for employees to be fully vaccinated applies whether they are teleworking, working remotely or working on-site. This is a condition of employment and it applies to indeterminate, determinate (term), casual, as and when required, and student hiring (full-time, part-time and seasonal). Should you reach the point in the selection process where it is necessary to ensure terms and conditions of employment are met, the hiring manager or a human resources representative will contact you in order to complete a vaccination attestation form.</div>

This document does not reflect all job duties or requirements for every position. Requirements build as one progresses through the job levels, so any job duties required at a lower level may be required at the higher level in addition to the duties listed for that higher level. Duties, assignments, and other responsibilities may differ for similar positions based on business conditions, departmental or geographic location, and/or needs for the particular position. An individual must demonstrate successful performance in their current position before being considered for promotion. In addition, in order to promote into a higher-level position, a business need for the promotion must exist and the candidate must be considered the most qualified person for the new position. Completion of certain milestones such as obtaining an advanced degree or certification, time in current position, or developing skills to perform at the higher-level role do not guarantee a promotion.</i></p><p></p><p><b><i>
