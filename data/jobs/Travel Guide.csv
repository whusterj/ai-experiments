With that said, we’re not tree-hugging sustainability gurus; we’re just regular people like you.<br><br>But regular people can make a big difference. You can help us work towards rescuing the 1.3 billion tonnes of unused food before it’s wasted every year, upcycle it, and make it accessible to 800 million people that go hungry daily.<br><br>We do it all with robotics, AI, automation, delicious food, and most importantly our quirky team of misfits. Our team doesn’t work here because they just need a job. They do it because this mission propels them and gives them an opportunity to personally grow and become a kick-a$$ change maker.<br><br><em>If this is something you can get behind, we want to hear from you. Just like the misfit food we rescue, tell us how you’re a misfit.<br><br></em><em>Trendi is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We know from experience that a diverse team that reflects our planet, partners and community stakeholders is central to ensuring varied perspectives and better ideas to solve the complex problem of food waste. Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion are unwavering and the core of how we build our team, cultivate leaders and create our impact.
