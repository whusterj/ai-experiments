The business has grown into the largest independently run spa in Canada and has expanded to a second location. Hammam Spa welcomes over 1,000 guests a week which requires a substantial number of products used for treatments and services. Céla was created when Celine searched for high-quality, clean products to use at the spa and was frustrated by the lack of thoughtful, Canadian-made options that were up to Hammam Spa's professional standards. A decision was made to explore ingredients available here at home within Canada. For over 8 years Celine sourced Canadian ingredients and made bases were tested and adapted to develop a selection of key formulas. Recognizing that the home was also an important place to build ritual and supplement wellness in-between treatments. In 2018 Celine sought out a proper manufacturer to start working on making the line into a scalable Canadian brand.</p>

Through this, IBH supports a diverse spectrum of research across THP, including biomedical, clinical, population health, health services and educational research, as well as leads research focused on population health and improving health services.   THPs mission of creating a new kind of health care for a healthier community is enabled by strategic research partnerships and collaboration of health researchers.

Research shows that even with new technology and drugs, children and youth living with diabetes are still not meeting recommended treatment targets. For example, their blood sugar control is poor, and they are more likely to have lower quality of life and develop other health problems such as heart or kidney disease. This is in part due to poor access to diabetes healthcare, which is worse in disadvantaged populations across Canada. We will develop strategies to address these gaps: The CAnadian PediAtric diabetes ConstortIum (CAPACIty) is a network of 10 childhood diabetes centres from across Canada, and their doctors and researchers who specialize in childhood diabetes. We will partner with patients/families and healthcare professionals to jointly design a Canada-wide childhood diabetes registry that will support improvements in clinical care, advance research, and inspire action by policymakers like improving coverage of diabetes technology and expanding support for diabetes in school. We will: (1) create an Advisory Board that will guide all aspects of the project and will include people living with/caring for a child with diabetes, health care professionals, researchers, and policymakers; (2) design and implement, in partnership with the Advisory Board, a childhood diabetes registry and quality improvement initiative called â€˜audit &amp; feedbackâ€™ where key clinical measures, that matter most to patients and families, are compared between Canadian diabetes centres; and (3) evaluate how this registry and audit &amp; feedback initiative inform action across all parts of the system including healthcare, research, policy and education. We are unique because we will focus on measuring indicators of inequality so that our strategies will positively impact the most disadvantaged children and youth living with diabetes, and their families.</p><p style=""margin:0px"">  </p><p style=""margin:0px""><strong>Role Requirements</strong></p><p style=""margin:0px"">The successful candidate must meet the following qualification and

Elle est depuis devenue une firme d'envergure mondiale qui compte maintenant 120 bureaux dans 20 pays. Certes, notre croissance a été rapide, mais ce qui compte le plus, c’est la conviction commune qui pousse nos 5 000 employés à faire de notre firme une société immobilière différente. Nous sommes d'avis que les lieux de vie, de travail et de loisir ont le pouvoir de nous rendre plus heureux et en meilleure santé, et nous sommes unis par un but commun : avoir un impact positif sur la vie des gens. Bref, nous sommes une société immobilière commerciale mondiale avec un objectif simple: que l’immobilier joue un rôle de premier plan dans la création d'espaces, de villes et de lieux dynamiques offrant une valeur sociale et un impact économique durables.</p><p style=""margin:0cm;text-align:justify""></p><p style=""margin:0cm;text-align:justify""><strong style=""font-weight:bold"">Pourquoi travailler ici?</strong></p><p style=""margin:0cm;text-align:justify""><strong style=""font-weight:bold""></strong></p><p style=""margin:0cm;text-align:justify"">Notre industrie est en changement constant et nous voulons que notre entreprise soit un lieu où se rencontrent des esprits curieux, des cœurs passionnés et des idées stratégiques.

Our expansion has been rapid, but what matters most is the common belief that drives all 5,000 of our people to be a different type of real estate organisation. We believe that the places in which we live, work and play have the power to make us happier and healthier, and we are united by a shared sense of purpose, to have a positive impact on people’s lives. In short, we are a global commercial real estate advisory firm with a simple aim: for real estate to play a leading role in creating vibrant buildings, cities and places that deliver long-lasting social value and economic impact.</p><p style=""margin:0cm;text-align:justify""></p><p style=""margin:0cm;text-align:justify""><strong style=""font-weight:bold"">Why Work for Us:</strong></p><p style=""margin:0cm;text-align:justify""><strong style=""font-weight:bold""></strong></p><p style=""margin:0cm;text-align:justify"">We believe that our industry is changing, and we want our business to be a melting pot of curious minds, passionate hearts and strategic intelligence. Your gender, religion and race are all highly respected, but are less important to us than your ability to step up and change the game. We provide you with a place where you can do just that, with like-minded people. Collaboration is embedded in the way we work – our people have the autonomy to collaborate on client relationships, engage teams across the business, lead operations, work collectively on projects, participate in strategy and are ultimately responsible for our growth. Our distinctive Principal-led, privately-owned model puts us in the enviable position of being able to offer every employee the opportunity to own a share of our business, and inspires and allows anyone to become a Principal. This role carries voting rights so our people have a very real say in the future direction and operation of our business.

You will focus on the question, “How do we better understand our users and their needs and motivations?” and iterate based on user feedback. The scope of your work will range from broad, exploratory research to inform product and company direction, to more focused studies.</p><p><br/></p><p>You will coordinate, design, and conduct qualitative and quantitative studies, and share your findings with the wider company, so that everyone has a common understanding of who our users are and the problems we’re trying to solve.

If you’re comfortable with quantitative data – you can analyze info in Google Analytics or similar tools – even better!</p><p><br/></p><p>User research is often misunderstood, so it’s important that you are able to hold your own with skeptics and patiently educate them on its benefits.

We’re a small, diverse team working at the cutting edge of machine learning. At Cohere, our mission is to build machines that understand the world and to make them safely accessible to all. Language is at the crux of this, but it can be difficult and expensive to parse the syntax, semantics, and context that all work together to give words meaning. The Cohere platform provides access to Large Language Models through its APIs that read billions of web pages and learn to understand the meaning, sentiment, and intent of the words we use in a richness never seen before.

We recently raised our Series B, signed a multi-year partnership with Google Cloud, and we are focused on bringing our technology to market. We will partner with customers so they can build natural language understanding and generation into their products with just a few lines of code.

We’re ambitious — we believe our technology will fundamentally transform how industries interact with natural language. And we have the technical chops to back it up - Cohere’s CEO, Aidan Gomez, is a co-author of the groundbreaking paper “Attention is all you need”, (over 23k citations) and was previously part of Google Brain. Our entire technical team is world-class.

We are focused on creating a diverse and inclusive work environment so that all of our team members can thrive. We welcome kind and brilliant people to our team, from wherever they come.

Why this role?
Design uncharted user experiences that augment all the others. Empower technologists to reimagine the building blocks of human-computer interaction: language.

Please Note: Our office is located in Toronto, Canada but this role is remote-flexible and is open to those located in either Canada or the US.




If some of the above doesn’t line up perfectly with your experience, we still encourage you to apply! If you consider yourself a thoughtful worker, a lifelong learner, and a kind and playful team member, Cohere is the place for you.

We welcome applicants of all kinds and are committed to providing both an equal opportunity process and work environment. We value and celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive work environment for all.

Our Perks: 
 An open and inclusive culture and work environment
‍ Work closely with a team on the cutting edge of AI research
 Free daily lunch
 Full health and dental benefits for employees based in Canada and the US, including a separate budget to take care of your mental health
 100% Parental Leave top-up for 6 months for employees based in Canada and 12 weeks in the US
 Personal enrichment benefits towards arts and culture, fitness and well-being, quality time, and workspace improvement
 Remote-flexible, offices in Toronto and Palo Alto and coworking stipend
✈️ 6 weeks of vacation and shared Canada/US holidays
