<p> Our Vision: A marine industry where safety and environmental protection are the top priorities, Transport Canada is building towards a future where industry operates at the maximum level of delegation possible, with the flexibility to meet safety requirements in the most cost-efficient manner. This means that the regulatory framework must be increasingly performance based to allow for the implementation of systematic approaches and to provide continuous improvement in safety performance. How we manage risk in the maritime world or what we do to prevent accidents from occurring in the first place becomes the logical and necessary focus of our endeavors. For the purposes of the Marine Safety Program and to bring our strategic goals into focus, Transport Canada Marine Safety and Security (TCMSS) defines safety as the condition where risks are managed to acceptable levels, which translates into our mission.<br/> <br/> Our Mission: To continuously maintain and enhance safety and the protection of life, health, property and the marine environment through: (a) the development, maintenance and implementation of an effective regulatory regime; (b) education and awareness; and (c) monitoring and enforcement.</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Work environment</b></h2>
<p> Inspectors must be leaders and skilled communicators capable of working effectively with others and adapting to the different needs of our clients. They must sometimes take rapid, decisive action and must be able to negotiate, facilitate behavior change and develop new competencies in client industries. Inspectors work in an environment of high stress due to the possible impact of error and real or potential conflict. In the course of ensuring that regulations are respected, inspectors carry significant responsibility and accountability and their decisions have a direct impact on the safety of Canadians.<br/> <br/> Transport Canada employs over 5,000 talented and motivated employees working in the Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario, Prairie and Northern, Pacific regions, and at our Ottawa Headquarters. We develop policies and enforce Acts and Regulations that support transportation efficiency, safety, security, durability, and align with global standards. Our vision is of a safe, secure, durable, innovative and integrated transportation system that supports trade and economic growth, a cleaner environment and the wellbeing of Canada’s middle class.<br/> <br/> We are an employer that fosters employee well-being, provides an open and respectful workplace, competitive benefits and flexible work schedules that promote work-life balance.<br/> <br/> Transport Canada is on the Forbes 2020 list of Canada’s best employers.</p>

<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Duties</b></h2><p>
Our Vision: A marine industry where safety and environmental protection are the top priorities, Transport Canada is building towards a future where industry operates at the maximum level of delegation possible, with the flexibility to meet safety requirements in the most cost-efficient manner. This means that the regulatory framework must be increasingly performance based to allow for the implementation of systematic approaches and to provide continuous improvement in safety performance. How we manage risk in the maritime world or what we do to prevent accidents from occurring in the first place becomes the logical and necessary focus of our endeavors. For the purposes of the Marine Safety Program and to bring our strategic goals into focus, Transport Canada Marine Safety and Security (TCMSS) defines safety as the condition where risks are managed to acceptable levels, which translates into our mission.<br/>
<br/>
Our Mission: To continuously maintain and enhance safety and the protection of life, health, property and the marine environment through: (a) the development, maintenance and implementation of an effective regulatory regime; (b) education and awareness; and (c) monitoring and enforcement.</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Work environment</b></h2><p>
Inspectors must be leaders and skilled communicators capable of working effectively with others and adapting to the different needs of our clients. They must sometimes take rapid, decisive action and must be able to negotiate, facilitate behavior change and develop new competencies in client industries. Inspectors work in an environment of high stress due to the possible impact of error and real or potential conflict. In the course of ensuring that regulations are respected, inspectors carry significant responsibility and accountability and their decisions have a direct impact on the safety of Canadians.<br/>
<br/>
Transport Canada employs over 5,000 talented and motivated employees working in the Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario, Prairie and Northern, Pacific regions, and at our Ottawa Headquarters. We develop policies and enforce Acts and Regulations that support transportation efficiency, safety, security, durability, and align with global standards. Our vision is of a safe, secure, durable, innovative and integrated transportation system that supports trade and economic growth, a cleaner environment and the wellbeing of Canada’s middle class.<br/>
<br/>
We are an employer that fosters employee well-being, provides an open and respectful workplace, competitive benefits and flexible work schedules that promote work-life balance.<br/>
<br/>
Transport Canada is on the Forbes 2020 list of Canada’s best employers.</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Intent of the process</b></h2>
<p>Transport Canada may establish a pool of qualified or partially qualified candidates which could be used to staff similar or identical positions with various tenures (such as indeterminate or specified period) for the Ontario Region.

<br/>We are traditional hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ speaking people. Today, we are a strong, growing community of over 1,300 members. We live on a small portion of our traditional territory, known as the Musqueam Indian Reserve, located south of Marine Drive near the mouth of the Fraser River. The name Musqueam relates back to the River Plant, the name of the plant is məθkʷəy̓. There is a story that has been passed on from generation to generation that explains how we became known as the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) - People of the River Plant. We have always moved throughout our territory using the resources it provides for fishing, hunting, trapping and gathering. We remain distinct and our cultural practices are strong, despite the devastating impacts of residential schools, colonial laws banning our ceremonies, and other attempts to assimilate our people. Our lands and waters continue to support our cultural and economic practices while serving as a source of knowledge and memory, encoded with our teachings and laws.
