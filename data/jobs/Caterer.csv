</b></p><p></p><p><b>About Unilever
</b></p><p>Unilever is one of the world’s leading suppliers of Food, Home and Personal Care products with sales in over 190 countries and reaching 2 billion consumers a day. Unilever has more than 400 brands found in homes around the world, including Dove, Tresemme, Lynx, Lifebuoy, Shea Moisture, Persil, Domestos, Ben &amp; Jerry’s, Magnum, Marmite, The Vegetarian Butcher, Graze and Pot Noodle.<br/>
</p><p></p><p>Faced with the challenge of climate change and the need for human development, we want to move towards a world where everyone can live well and within the natural limits of the planet. That’s why our purpose is ‘to make sustainable living commonplace’<br/>
</p><p></p><p><b>Location
</b></p><p>In September 2020, Unilever announced the intention to build a new sustainable campus site in Kingston, London to house the employees who currently work in 100 Victoria Embankment in Blackfriars, Lever House in Kingston, Unilever House in Leatherhead and Graze in Richmond. We are creating our own Unilever sustainable, agile work environment, purposefully bringing us together in our own Unilever ecosystem. The campus is due to be completed in December 2023 and will consist of two interconnected buildings, as well as landscaped surrounding areas.<br/>
</p><p></p><p><b>What We Offer
</b></p><p>Not only do we offer a competitive salary and pension scheme, we also offer an annual bonus, free gym, a discounted staff shop and shares. You’ll have the opportunity to work directly with our renowned and exciting brands in a flexible and hybrid working environment.<br/>
</p><p></p><p>Whilst the role is advertised on a full-time basis, we would be happy to discuss possible flexible working options and what this may look like for you. We are a key advocate of wellbeing and offer a variety of support for our people including hubs, programmes and development opportunities. We strive to achieve a family-friendly and inclusive workplace and to, above all, create possibilities for all.<br/>
</p><p></p><p>Diversity at Unilever is about inclusion, embracing differences, creating possibilities and growing together for better business performance. We embrace diversity in our workforce. This means giving full and fair consideration to all applicants and continuing development of all employees regardless of age, disability, gender reassignment, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, marriage and civil partnership, and pregnancy and maternity. We are also more than happy to provide reasonable adjustments during our application and interview process to enable you to be present your best self.<br/>
</p><p></p><p><b>Recruitment Fraud
</b></p><p>Cyber criminals advertise fake job adverts with prestigious employers as a way of stealing information or even defrauding individuals out of money. In the most sophisticated cases, they will set up fake websites, which have a similar address to companies like Unilever. They even conduct fake telephone interviews and then offer candidates a role with the proviso they pay a fee for background checks or to cover work visa costs. These types of attacks are becoming more common as more people are looking for employment in the economic climate.<br/>
</p><p></p><p><b>How is Unilever tackling this?
</b></p><p>Many of Unilever’s recruitment sites publish a warning to candidates about recruitment fraud. The Cyber Security team also proactively scan for signs of people setting up fake Unilever sites and act to close them down.<br/>
</p><p></p><p><b>What can I do?
</b></p><p>If you become aware of potential recruitment fraud, spot fake Unilever recruitment adverts or fake LinkedIn profiles, report them via Una Live Chat.<br/>
</p><p></p><p>Unilever does not accept responsibility or liability for any candidates who are financially impacted by recruitment fraud. Your vigilance is key!

<p></p>
<div>
<p>How about driving a truck filled with Ontario’s most delicious, farm-fresh food, as part of a team that’s trying to make the world a more fair and more delicious place?</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p> If the idea of good food, good people, and independence on the road sound good to you, we’d love to meet you.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p> We’re 100km Foods and we’re looking to add 1 commercial truck driver to our team. This is a full-time position with medical and dental benefits after 3 months and a company matching retirement savings plan after 1 year.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p><b> Why Work @ 100km Foods</b></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p> 100km Foods started to connect local farmers with urban markets. Through us, farmers get access to large, urban markets and urban people get access to delicious, farm-fresh food. It’s a win-win for all involved.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p> We deal fairly with farmers, allowing them to set their own prices, and we seek to treat all of our employees, suppliers, clients, and community with a high standard of fairness and cooperation. That led us to become a certified B Corp (ever heard of that?).</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p> Working with us, you’ll get to be a part of that purpose. You’ll work with great people who care about what they do, who bring a positive attitude to work, and who like to have fun.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p> You’ll also have freedom to do your job and solve problems independently. In fact, the best drivers are the ones who can creatively resolve day-to-day problems – a crop that’s been delayed or an item that was left behind – keeping both farmers and clients happy.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p> You’ll also get lots of variety – approximately half your work week will be spent driving through southern Ontario farmland (approx. 100 km radius from Toronto), collecting items from our many farm partners, and then returning them to the warehouse. The other half of your week, you’re loading up your truck and making deliveries to some of Ontario's best chefs and restaurants.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p> If that sounds good, we’re looking for a driver for approximately 40 hours per week.</p>
<p> Wages start at $20/hour</p>
<p> Perks of the job include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medical and Dental Benefits, fully paid by the employer, after 3 months</li>
<li>At cost purchasing account for employees to buy groceries for themselves and their family at wholesale prices.</li>
<li>Company matching retirement savings plan after 1 year</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p><b> Qualifications</b></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p> Absolutely essential:</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<ul>

<li>You have a valid G Ontario driver's license with a clean abstract</li>
<li>You can lift and carry up to 50 pounds</li>
<li>You are fluent in English</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p> Ideally, you also have experience in these areas:</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Experience doing a customer service job</li>
<li>Experience using a hand truck, dolly or similar equipment</li>
<li>Excellent knowledge of Toronto and southern Ontario driving routes</li>
<li>A food handler’s certificate and/or experience in food handling or distribution</li>
