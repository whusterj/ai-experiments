<p> The Emerging Artist (EA) Program is designed to help young Canadian musicians navigate the next level of their career, whether that is a national tour, preparing for export, or any other major stepping stone from the beginner level to the intermediate. We have roles for singer-songwriters, self-accompanied vocalists, and instrumentalists (including backline performers on bass, drums, keys, guitar, and horns).</p>
<p> EAs will get structured training from a variety of industry professionals in navigating the intricacies of the music industry, gaining skills and knowledge crucial for career growth along the way. The primary focus of this program is to provide support for and animate our communities and to build sustainability in our artistic workforce. Hours not spent performing will be occupied with workshops, training, and hands-on activities to prepare EAs for levelling up their business. Some performers may be selected as principal roles in our end-of-summer touring Showcase.</p>

We have roles for singer-songwriters, self-accompanied vocalists, and instrumentalists (including backline performers on bass, drums, keys, guitar, and horns).</p>
<p> Over the course of two months in the summer, Pre-Professional Program Artists participate in workshops and a variety of skill-building opportunities to improve their understanding of the music industry. They split their time between performance (online or in-person) and training that builds a foundational understanding of the Canadian Music Industry at large.</p>
<p><b> If you would like to be considered for both the Emerging Artist and Pre-Professional Program, please only submit the EA application, and indicate that you would like to be considered for both in the pre-screening questionnaire.</b></p>

<p> To have your application considered by the Jury, all pre-interview questions must be filled out completely.</p>
<p> Please note that there are no part-time or performance-only positions this year.</p>

<p><b><br/> The Co-op also offers the Emerging Artist Program, which may better suit musicians with a higher level of skill.</b></p>

We have roles for singer-songwriters, self-accompanied vocalists, and instrumentalists (including backline performers on bass, drums, keys, guitar, and horns).</p>
<p> EAs will get structured training from a variety of industry professionals in navigating the intricacies of the music industry, gaining skills and knowledge crucial for career growth along the way. The primary focus of this program is to provide support for and animate our communities and to build sustainability in our artistic workforce. Hours not spent performing will be occupied with workshops, training, and hands-on activities to prepare EAs for levelling up their business. Some performers may be selected as principal roles in our end-of-summer touring Showcase.</p>
<p> Those who apply for only the Pre-Professional Program will not be considered for the EA program. If you want to be considered for the EA program, please apply under the EA job posting and indicate that you would also like to be considered for the Pre-Professional Program.</p>
