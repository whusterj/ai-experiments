Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.<strong> </strong> Visit us at Netskope Careers.

You will play a hybrid role, straddling pre-sales and professional services. You will work with engineering teams, customers and sales teams to write Statements of Work that the professional services team can successfully execute. You will also oversee the technical output of professional services engineers on active customer engagements. For enterprise customer engagements, you may be responsible for overseeing the technical output of multiple work streams that are part of a larger program. </div><div> </div><div>You're hands-on, able to conduct experiments, build functioning prototypes that prove out ideas, and use such evidence to instill confidence in the solutions you advocate. This will occur in the context of pre-sales, where convincing enterprise customers to engage with SADA requires the demonstration of technical credibility early in the sales cycle. It will also occur in the context of paid discovery when our active engagements demand the vetting of one or more architectures to problem domains. </div><div> </div><div>You're comfortable leading conversations with sophisticated customers on a macro- and micro-level. This means helping to ideate and promote the ""big picture"" vision for a customer, as well as hone in on a specific scope that can memorialized in a concrete statement of work. As a result, you need to have a deep understanding of what GCP has to offer, and understand how to calibrate your communication based on the audience.</div><div> </div><div>You also have a kinship with engineering practitioners, rolling up your sleeves and going deep technically as you work through the details of implementing an architecture. </div><div> </div><div>You will be a recognized expert within SADA and will develop a reputation with customers as well as the Google Cloud sales and professional services organizations for the quality of your work. You will demonstrate repeated delivery of project architectures that other engineers and architects demur to you for lack of expertise. </div><div> </div><div><strong>Pathway to Success </strong></div><div> </div><div>#BeOneStepAhead: You are a rainmaker! You are out front of our delivery organization, meeting with the spectrum of corporate and enterprise customers that need our consultative services.
