In the course of ensuring that regulations are respected, inspectors carry significant responsibility and accountability and their decisions have a direct impact on the safety of Canadians.<br/> <br/> Transport Canada employs over 5,000 talented and motivated employees working in the Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario, Prairie and Northern, Pacific regions, and at our Ottawa Headquarters.

        <br><strong>Aperçu<br><br><br></strong>Les technicien(ne)s de marine sont responsables du fonctionnement et de l’entretien de systèmes de propulsion et de systèmes mécaniques et électriques hautement perfectionnés, permettant ainsi aux navires de guerre de la Marine royale canadienne de flotter, bouger et combattre.<br><br>Les principales responsabilités des technicien(ne) de marine sont les suivantes : faire fonctionner tout l’équipement d’ingénierie des systèmes maritimes à bord des navires, trouver la cause des défaillances, aviser le commandement des limites et effectuer les réparations nécessaires pour remettre les systèmes en marche. Les technicien(ne) de marine établissent et suivent un calendrier de maintenance pour garder l’équipement d’ingénierie du navire en bon état. Ils interviennent en cas d’urgence, notamment en situation de lutte contre les incendies et de contrôle des avaries, y compris lors de l’écrasement d’hélicoptères. Ce sont les spécialistes de la métallurgie du navire et ils effectuent des travaux de brûlage, de soudage et d’usinage.<br><br>Le commandement se fie sur la connaissance approfondie qu’ont les technicien(ne) de marine :<br><ul><li>des moteurs de propulsion à turbine à gaz ou au diesel et des systèmes connexes, y compris des engrenages et de la ligne d’arbre;</li><li>des génératrices et des réseaux de distribution d’électricité, y compris de l’alimentation de secours;</li><li>de l’équipement et des systèmes hydrauliques;</li><li>des systèmes de contrôle de l’équipement électronique;</li><li>de l’équipement de contrôle des avaries et de lutte contre les incendies</li><li>du matériel de réfrigération, de climatisation et de ventilation; et</li><li>des systèmes de gestion du carburant et d’autres liquides.</li></ul> <br><strong>Environnement de travail<br><br><br></strong>Les technicien(ne)s de marine passent la majeure partie de leur carrière à bord de navires basés à Halifax, en Nouvelle-Écosse ou à Esquimalt, en Colombie-Britannique. Ils vivent et expérimentent les défis uniques qui découlent du travail en mer, comme l’exécution de tâches dans des espaces réduits et peu éclairés. Ils seront parfois appelés à travailler sur des ponts découverts pour effectuer la réparation et l’entretien de l’équipement dans diverses conditions météorologiques. En mer, tous les membres de l’équipage du navire travaillent par quarts. À terre, les technicien(ne)s de marine travaillent habituellement sur les quarts de jour.<br><br>En plus de leurs fonctions principales, les technicien(ne)s de marine subalternes effectuent des tâches générales non liées à leur profession, comme nettoyer, peindre, travailler à la cafétéria et charger des provisions.<br><br><strong>Programmes d’enrôlement<br></strong><ul><li> Études exigées </li><li> Options d’enrôlement direct </li><li> Options d’études subventionnées <br></li></ul>Ce poste exige que les candidats aient terminé au minimum leur 10e année d’études secondaires, ou la 4e au Québec ou l’équivalent, comportant :<br><ul><li>Mathématiques théorique de 10e année ou Mathématiques 426; ou</li><li>Mathématiques appliquées de 12e année ou mathématiques 526<br></li></ul>Les candidats détenant un CEES doivent également avoir suivi un cours de mathématiques théorique de 10e année (ou mathématiques 426) ou de mathématiques appliquées de 12e année (ou mathématiques 526).<br><br>Si vous détenez déjà un diplôme d’études collégiales ou un « Sceau rouge » pour un métier civil connexe, les Forces décideront si votre programme de formation remplit les critères du poste, et vous pourriez être envoyé directement à une formation en cours d’emploi après avoir obtenu votre qualification militaire de base. Cette qualification et la formation en cours d’emploi militaire sont requises avant toute affectation.<br><br>Programme d’instruction et d’études subventionnées à l’intention des militaires du rang (PIES-MR)<br><br>Comme le poste en question nécessite une formation spécialisée, les FAC paieront les frais de scolarité des recrues retenues qui suivent un programme agréé d’un collège canadien. Les étudiants du PIES-MR suivent la qualification militaire de base et une formation en cours d’emploi durant les mois d’été. Le salaire à temps plein comprend les soins médicaux et dentaires, ainsi que des vacances payées (à plein salaire). En échange du paiement des études collégiales, les candidats s’engagent à servir dans les FAC pendant une certaine période de temps. Si vous voulez participer au programme, vous devez faire une demande auprès des FAC et du collège approprié. Pour de plus amples renseignements, consultez les Études payées.<br><br><strong>Instruction<br><br></strong>La première étape de l’instruction est le Cours de qualification militaire de base, ou instruction de base, qui est offert à l’École de leadership et de recrues des Forces canadiennes à Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, au Québec. Cette instruction permet d’acquérir les compétences et les connaissances élémentaires communes à tous les groupes professionnels. Comme l’un des objectifs du cours est de veiller à ce que toutes les recrues respectent constamment la norme de condition physique des Forces, l’instruction est exigeante sur le plan physique.<br><br>Les technicien(ne)s de marine fréquentent l’École navale (Pacifique) à Esquimalt, en Colombie-Britannique. L’instruction dure plusieurs mois et porte sur les sujets suivants :<br><ul><li>Théorie élémentaire des systèmes mécaniques, électriques et de coque</li><li>Maintenance corrective et préventive de base des systèmes maritimes</li><li>Rondes de vérification des systèmes de propulsion et accessoires</li><li>Procédures de mise en marche et d’arrêt de l’équipement</li><li>Procédures élémentaires d’intervention d’urgence en cas de défaillances de l’équipement</li><li>Fonctionnement d’équipement de soudure et de brûlage d’urgence</li><li>Réparation des dispositifs de fermeture étanches et non étanches à l’eau<br></li></ul>Les technicien(ne)s de marine pourraient avoir la possibilité d’acquérir des compétences spécialisées par l’intermédiaire de cours magistraux ou d’une formation en cours d’emploi, par exemple :<br><ul><li>Lutte contre les incendies en cas d’écrasement d’hélicoptère</li><li>Soudage</li><li>Fabrication et usinage</li><li>Inspection de moteurs diesel</li><li>Entretien de turbines à gaz<br></li></ul>À mesure qu’ils progresseront dans leur carrière, les technicien(ne)s de marine qui manifesteront les capacités et le potentiel nécessaires pourront suivre de l’instruction avancée, dont les cours suivants :<br><ul><li>Techniques avancées de maintenance corrective et préventive des systèmes mécaniques</li><li>Techniques avancées de maintenance corrective et préventive des systèmes électriques</li><li>Fonctionnement des stations et supervision du personnel de quart</li><li>Techniques avancées de lutte contre les incendies et de contrôle des avaries</li><li>Gestion du radoub</li><li>Gestion du cycle de vie de l’équipement</li><li>Gestion de la maintenance<br></li></ul>Les recrues de la Marine fréquentent l’École navale (Pacifique) à Esquimalt, en Colombie-Britannique, ou l’École navale (Atlantique) à Halifax, en Nouvelle-Écosse, pendant environ cinq semaines. Cette formation porte sur les sujets suivants :<br><ul><li>Histoire et organisation de la Marine royale canadienne</li><li>Lutte contre les incendies et contrôle des avaries à bord des navires</li><li>Sécurité à bord des navires</li><li>Services de quart</li><li>Matelotage<br></li></ul><strong>Options à temps partiel<br><br></strong>Cette possibilité d’emploi à temps partiel est offerte auprès de la Première réserve, à certains endroits au Canada. En règle générale, les membres de la Force de réserve servent à temps partiel au sein d’une unité militaire dans leur communauté et peuvent effectuer leur service pendant qu’ils sont aux études ou qu’ils occupent un emploi civil. Ils sont payés durant leur instruction. Ils ne sont pas assujettis aux affectations ni aux déménagements militaires.
