<div>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Summary of Position</b></h2>
<p> The Waterdown Montessori School teacher is responsible for providing a Montessori classroom/instructional program that supports the individual needs of the children in accordance with the School’s mission and vision. The Waterdown Montessori teacher creates a well-prepared environment and an atmosphere of learning and inquisitiveness designed to move students from one activity and level to the next. You will step back while the children are working, allowing them to learn from their own discoveries and draw their own conclusions. Rather than supplying children with answers, you will ask them how they would solve the problem, actively engaging children in the learning process and enhancing critical thinking skills.</p>
<p> Dr. Montessori believed that the teacher should focus on the child as a person rather than on the daily lesson plans. Although our Montessori teachers plan daily lessons for each child, s/he must be alert to changes in the child’s interest, progress, mood, and behavior.</p>
<p> Subjects are interwoven and you must have a general understanding of history, art, music, math, astronomy, chemistry, physical geography, language, physics, geometry, and practical life works. As one of our teachers, you will give one-on-one or small group lessons and spend little time giving large group lessons. Lessons are brief and precise, meant to intrigue the minds of children so that they come back to learn more on their own. Montessori lessons center around the most basic information necessary for the children to do the work: the name of the materials, where it can be found in the classroom and on the shelf, how to use the materials, and what can be done with them.</p>
<p> Teachers at Waterdown Montessori School are scientific observers of children. They avoid using rewards and punishments for good or poor work. You will never criticize or interfere in a child’s work and we recognize that it is only in a trusting atmosphere that a child’s personality has room to grow. Children must have the freedom to choose their own activities and learn to behave without restriction.</p>

<p> But additionally, we are also seeking professional performers with active music-industry careers who find satisfaction in sharing their knowledge and enhancing their income in a flexible, credible way. These artists act as adjudicators, guest lecturers, course contributors, remote coaches for elite students, and content contributors.</p>
<p> Our piano teachers hail from throughout the GTA, including Etobicoke, Markham, Richmond Hill, North York, Hamilton, Burlington, Oakville, Mississauga, Toronto, Vaughan, Brampton, Scarborough, and more.</p>

<div>
<p>The Seabird Island Band is a multi-faceted First Nations Band that includes government, business, service, and nonprofit services. We work as an integrated team to improve the health, education, and economic opportunities for First Nations people to create thriving First Nations families and communities.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/> Position Summary:</b></p>
<p> The start date of this position is August 30, 2021 and will end June 30, 2022. This position involves the provision of instruction to students of Seabird Island Community School/High School and includes instruction, preparation, assessment, classroom management, professional development and school meetings, community and parental relations and adherence to all Seabird Island Community School and BC Ministry of Education policies and procedures.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i><br/> Seabird Island Band is committed to the health and safety of its employee's and community members. SIB has implemented measures to protect and prevent the spread of COVID-19. SIB is mandated under provincial health care standards that all employees provide proof of vaccination for COVID-19 unless otherwise deemed exempt under the Human Rights Code</i></p>
<p><br/> <b> First Peoples Principles of Learning</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li> Learning ultimately supports the well-being of the self, the family, the community, the land, the spirits, and the ancestors.<br/> </li>
<li>Learning is holistic, reflexive, reflective, experiential, and relational (focused on connectedness, on reciprocal relationships, and a sense of place).<br/> </li>
<li>Learning involves recognizing the consequences of one’s actions.<br/> </li>
<li>Learning involves generational roles and responsibilities.<br/> </li>
<li>Learning recognizes the role of indigenous knowledge.<br/> </li>
<li>Learning is embedded in memory, history, and story.<br/> </li>
<li>Learning involves patience and time.<br/> </li>
<li>Learning requires exploration of one’s identity.<br/> </li>
<li>Learning involves recognizing that some knowledge is sacred and only shared with permission and/or in certain situations.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p> The Grade 4 Teacher is expected to value Indigenous ways of knowing and be willing to be guided by the recognition of ways of learning inherent within First Nations’ worldviews. The 9 First Peoples Principles of Learning must form an integral part of planning and delivering lessons. The lessons must be learner centred, inquiry based, prioritize experiential learning, emphasize an awareness of self and others equally, value collaborative learning and support a variety of learning styles. Prepared lessons and activities should help students develop their unique self-knowledge as well as knowledge and understanding of recurring themes in the world view of many First Nations including connections to land and environment, spirit and spirituality, sustainability and continuity, story and identity as well as the significance of oral tradition. The Grade 4 Teacher believes that all students can learn and understands that she/he is leading students through a very critical transition in their academic and social lives. The students are on the cusp of high school and expectations around being more focused, organized, independent and responsible are consistently increasing. The Teacher is a guide during this turbulent time and helps students learn to manage themselves so that they do not become overwhelmed. Emphasizing personalized learning and providing flexibility in terms of the variety of ways in which students can show what they know is expected. It is also expected that the Grade 4 Teacher will move students forward in their understanding of social and personal responsibilities.</p>
<p><br/> In terms of year plans, which are due to the principal every year at the end of September, an overarching guiding question that permeates it should be, am I teaching students to think? If so, where is the evidence of that in my planning? We are no longer looking simply at the quantity of content that is being covered, instead the destination is having students arrive at evidence of their own authentic, sophisticated thinking. Content is a vehicle that can get them there. Looking at the revised B.C. curriculum it is important to keep in mind that the goal is to create learning that prepares students for the 21st century and this means a great deal of focus on helping our students become critical, creative and collaborative thinkers. A key word used to explain this goal for our students is adaptability. Tom Schimmer is constantly asking us as teachers to maximize our students’ possibilities for adaptability. Some important questions to consider are as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><br/> Are the First Nations Principles of Learning explicit in my planning?</li>
<li>Are curricular and core competencies explicitly stated and connected to assessment?</li>
<li>Are cross curricular connections clearly outlined?</li>
<li>How will I know that the students have grasped the core competencies and what will I do if they don’t?</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p><b> Qualifications/Requirements:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Bachelors in Education<br/> </li>
<li>Must be a BC Certified Teacher.<br/> </li>
<li>Possess knowledge and understanding in concepts of First Nations ways of knowing/learning and current events pertaining to the instruction of grade 6 students.<br/> </li>
<li>2-3 years’ experience in a similar role is preferred.<br/> </li>
<li>Standard First Aid and CPR certification is considered an asset.<br/> </li>
<li>Possess strong leadership, public-speaking, and classroom management skills in order to successfully instruct students in the manner in which they should do particular activities.</li>
<li>Proficient computer skills including Microsoft Office Applications (Word, Excel, Internet, and Email).<br/> </li>
<li>Excellent verbal and written communication skills.<br/> </li>

<div>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Summary of Position</b></h2>
<p> The Waterdown Montessori School teacher is responsible for providing a Montessori classroom/instructional program that supports the individual needs of the children in accordance with the School’s mission and vision. The Waterdown Montessori teacher creates a well-prepared environment and an atmosphere of learning and inquisitiveness designed to move students from one activity and level to the next. You will step back while the children are working, allowing them to learn from their own discoveries and draw their own conclusions. Rather than supplying children with answers, you will ask them how they would solve the problem, actively engaging children in the learning process and enhancing critical thinking skills.</p>
<p> Dr. Montessori believed that the teacher should focus on the child as a person rather than on the daily lesson plans. Although our Montessori teachers plan daily lessons for each child, s/he must be alert to changes in the child’s interest, progress, mood, and behavior.</p>
<p> Subjects are interwoven and you must have a general understanding of history, art, music, math, astronomy, chemistry, physical geography, language, physics, geometry, and practical life works. As one of our teachers, you will give one-on-one or small group lessons and spend little time giving large group lessons. Lessons are brief and precise, meant to intrigue the minds of children so that they come back to learn more on their own. Montessori lessons center around the most basic information necessary for the children to do the work: the name of the materials, where it can be found in the classroom and on the shelf, how to use the materials, and what can be done with them.</p>
<p> Teachers at Waterdown Montessori School are scientific observers of children. They avoid using rewards and punishments for good or poor work. You will never criticize or interfere in a child’s work and we recognize that it is only in a trusting atmosphere that a child’s personality has room to grow. Children must have the freedom to choose their own activities and learn to behave without restriction.</p>

First Peoples Principles of Learning</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Learning ultimately supports the well-being of the self, the family, the community, the land, the spirits, and the ancestors.<br/>
</li>
<li>Learning is holistic, reflexive, reflective, experiential, and relational (focused on connectedness, on reciprocal relationships, and a sense of place).<br/>
</li>
<li>Learning involves recognizing the consequences of one’s actions.<br/>
</li>
<li>Learning involves generational roles and responsibilities.<br/>
</li>
<li>Learning recognizes the role of indigenous knowledge.<br/>
</li>
<li>Learning is embedded in memory, history, and story.<br/>
</li>
<li>Learning involves patience and time.<br/>
</li>
<li>Learning requires exploration of one’s identity.<br/>
</li>
<li>Learning involves recognizing that some knowledge is sacred and only shared with permission and/or in certain situations.</li></ul><br/>
<p></p>
<p>
The High School Science Teacher is expected to value Indigenous ways of knowing and be willing to be guided by the recognition of ways of learning inherent within First Nations’ worldviews. The 9 First Peoples Principles of Learning must form an integral part of planning and delivering lessons. The lessons must be learner centred, inquiry based, prioritize experiential learning, emphasize an awareness of self and others equally, value collaborative learning and support a variety of learning styles. Prepared lessons and activities should help students develop their unique self-knowledge as well as knowledge and understanding of recurring themes in the world view of many First Nations including connections to land and environment, spirit and spirituality, sustainability and continuity, story and identity as well as the significance of oral tradition. The High School Science Teacher believes that all students can learn and understands that she/he is leading students through a very critical transition in their academic and social lives. The students are on the cusp of high school and expectations around being more focused, organized, independent and responsible are consistently increasing. The Teacher is a guide during this turbulent time and helps students learn to manage themselves so that they do not become overwhelmed. Emphasizing personalized learning and providing flexibility in terms of the variety of ways in which students can show what they know is expected. It is also expected that the High School Science Teacher will move students forward in their understanding of social and personal responsibilities.</p><p><br/>
In terms of year plans, which are due to the principal every year at the end of September, an overarching guiding question that permeates it should be, am I teaching students to think? If so, where is the evidence of that in my planning? We are no longer looking simply at the quantity of content that is being covered, instead the destination is having students arrive at evidence of their own authentic, sophisticated thinking. Content is a vehicle that can get them there. Looking at the revised B.C. curriculum it is important to keep in mind that the goal is to create learning that prepares students for the 21st century and this means a great deal of focus on helping our students become critical, creative and collaborative thinkers. A key word used to explain this goal for our students is adaptability. Tom Schimmer is constantly asking us as teachers to maximize our students’ possibilities for adaptability. Some important questions to consider are as follows:</p><p></p><ul><li><br/>
Are the First Nations Principles of Learning explicit in my planning?</li><li>Are curricular and core competencies explicitly stated and connected to assessment?</li><li>Are cross curricular connections clearly outlined?</li><li>How will I know that the students have grasped the core competencies and what will I do if they don’t?</li></ul><p></p><p><b><br/>

We recognize the key difference that teachers make in the lives of our learners. We are looking for strong, capable teachers who have the desire ""to advance student achievement and well-being through public education, which motivates learners, fosters inclusion, inspires innovation and builds community"".

 <br/>
<br/>
<b>Note:</b> At YRDSB, if you are added to the Occasional Teacher Roster, Social Science courses are categorized as either Family Studies or History. If your second teachable falls under Social Science (e.g. psychology, history, law, family studies, etc.) we request that you include a copy of your transcript(s) in your online application as this may be required in determining your eligibility. If all of your courses fall under Family Studies or History, you would be required to obtain an additional qualification outside of Social Science in order to be considered for the Secondary Occasional Teacher Roster. 
 <br/>
<br/>
<b>Additional Information:</b>
<br/> In order to be considered for Secondary Occasional Teaching, you must have qualifications in both Intermediate and Senior. If you are Primary/Junior qualified only, please do not submit an application to Secondary Occasional teaching. We would encourage you to review and apply to the active job postings, including the Elementary Occasional Teaching job posting. 
 <br/>
<br/> If you are a current YRDSB employee (permanent or temporary/term) and are successful through the OT selection process, you will be required to remain in your current position until the next approved natural break (i.e. Winter Break, March Break, End of Term One, End of Semester). 
 <br/>
<br/> If you are not currently a member in good standing with the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT), your application may still be considered although you would not be eligible to be added to the Occasional Teacher Roster until membership is confirmed. 
 <br/>
<br/> If you are applying to both Elementary and Secondary Occasional Teaching at YRDSB, you will only be eligible to be on one (1) of the two (2) Occasional Teaching Rosters. Therefore, it is important that you prioritize which list you prefer (Elementary or Secondary) as once you accept a position on the Occasional Teacher Roster, your application will be inactivated from the other teacher job posting(s). 
 <br/>
<br/> In the application process, you will be prompted to provide at least three (3) professional, supervisory teaching references (including full name, position title, work location/organization, and email address) in the job posting screening section of the online application. We do not contact references prior to practicum/interview. 
 <br/>
<br/>
<b>Examples of referees could include the following:</b>
<br/> Principal/Vice-Principal that has supervised you and can speak to your teaching practice in the panel to which you are applying; 
 <br/>
<br/> Faculty Advisor/Coordinator or Practicum Advisor that has observed and evaluated your teaching practice in a classroom setting; 
 <br/>
<br/> Host/Mentor Teacher that has supervised you and can speak to your teaching practice in a secondary setting; and/or 
 <br/>
<br/> Professional reference who can speak to your teaching practice. 
 <br/>

<b>For candidates applying to teach French:</b>
<br/> Candidates are encouraged to review the Teach en français page on our Board website for additional information regarding our Hiring Process, Resources, and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). 
 <br/>
<br/>
<b>French Language Assessment (FLA):</b>
<br/> This is the first stage of the selection process for all teachers interested in teaching French as a Second Language (FSL) with the York Region District School Board; 
 <br/>
<br/>
<b>This assessment is used to assess the four language skills:</b> listening, speaking, reading, and writing and is completed by YRDSB French Language Assessor(s); and 
 <br/>
<br/> Candidates must complete or currently have a successful French Language Assessment and be deemed to have language skills appropriate for our French program. 
 <br/>
<br/>
<b>Additional Information for French candidates:</b>
<br/> Candidates must be members in good standing or in the process of becoming Ontario College of Teachers (OCT) qualified with the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT) prior to the start date, and be enrolled or have completed their French as a Second Language (FSL), or equivalent, based on Ontario College of Teachers qualifications.

<br/> Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Statement 
 <br/>
<br/> The York Region District School Board (YRDSB) believes in giving each and every applicant an equal opportunity to succeed on their own merit and we strive to hire staff that reflect and support the diverse perspectives, experiences and needs of our students and our communities. We remain committed to upholding the values of equity, diversity, and inclusion in our living, learning and work environments. We know that diversity underpins excellence, and that we all share responsibility for creating an equitable, diverse and inclusive Board-community. Therefore, in pursuit of our values, we seek members who will work respectfully and constructively with differences and across the organizational hierarchy in actualizing the Board’s priorities, goals and principles outlined in the Director’s Action Plan.

 <br/>
<br/> At YRDSB, we recognize that many of these identities intersect and therefore, equity, diversity and inclusion can be complex.

 <br/>
<br/> of employment, successful candidates will be required to submit a current

<p><b>Assistant Professor in Anthropology </b></p>
<p>Department of Sociology and Anthropology </p>
<p>Thompson Rivers University (TRU) is a uniquely comprehensive, student-focused institution built on over 40 years of excellence in post-secondary education and training. TRU's spectacular main campus is located on the land of the Tk’emlups te Secwépemc, the traditional and unceded territory of the Secwépemc people in Kamloops, BC. A mere four-hour drive from Vancouver, in the heart of the southern BC interior, Kamloops offers world class tourism and recreation, excellent cultural, social, and economic opportunities, as well as over 2,000 hours of sunshine annually.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p>The Faculty of Arts invites applications for a full-time tenure-track assistant professor position in Anthropology with a specialization in the areas of decolonization and Indigenous peoples. As part of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology’s commitment to respond to the Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and in recognition of the mandate of this position in Indigenous-focused scholarship and teaching in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology, we are inviting qualified candidates who identify as Indigenous to apply. With applicant’s permission, TRU will verify connection with the Indigenous community identified by the applicant.</p>
<p>This position balances teaching and research, with strong service and community engagement within the interdisciplinary Department of Sociology and Anthropology. Applications are invited in any area of research from any of anthropology’s subfields with a focus on Indigenous research, teaching and service activities that include the application of Indigenous knowledge and/or ethical engagement and collaboration with Indigenous communities, organizations and/or institutions. Strong ties to Indigenous communities will be particularly valued. The Department of Sociology and Anthropology, guided by the Secwépemc Nation Research Ethics Guidelines, recognizes that Indigenous research is a relational process that Indigenous scholars may engage in to support community self-determination and is a process that requires considerable time, commitment, and principled approaches which is broader than mainstream conceptualizations and definitions of research.</p>
<p>The Department of Sociology and Anthropology is committed to a process of decolonizing and Indigenizing our spaces, pedagogies, course offerings, processes, standards for tenure and promotion, and understandings of teaching, research, and service. As a department we are committed to respectfully supporting and honouring the contribution Indigenous scholars offer our community. We recognize the entangled history of anthropology and colonialism and actively work to critically acknowledge the harms done to Indigenous peoples globally by the discipline. The successful candidate will contribute to this effort by expanding the critical Indigenous studies offerings in anthropology, and to teaching and research supervision at the Master of Arts level within the pending MA in Human Rights and Social Justice housed in the Faculty of Arts.</p>
<p>The successful candidate will contribute to sustaining the collegiality and reputation of the department, with service responsibilities to support Departmental initiatives initially, and expanding to include activities to support Divisional and Institutional objectives. The successful candidate will be committed to scholarly teaching with the potential to be an outstanding teacher and demonstrate an ability to engage diverse student populations. Candidates are invited to describe their approach to considering equity, diversity, and inclusion in their research, teaching, and service in their application.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
      QUALIFICATIONS 
     </div>
<div>
<p>A PhD in Anthropology, a closely related discipline, or relevant interdisciplinary program should be held by time of appointment.

136,ASSISTANT PROFESSOR,McMaster University,"Hamilton, ON",https://ca.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=7d213026cdf39d84&fccid=3623ed8ea4c76fba&vjs=3,"<div class=""jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"" id=""jobDescriptionText"">The Lynton R. Wilson Institute for Canadian History at McMaster University in conjunction with the Department of History and Faculty of Humanities is looking to fill two L.R. Wilson Assistant Professorships in Canadian History.
<br/><br/>
The Wilson Institute has as its mission the rethinking of Canadian History within a transnational framework. This perspective involves studying the ways in which Canadians have contributed to and been influenced by transnational phenomena such as international migration, Diaspora politics, religious movements, changing conceptions of human rights, postcolonialism, wars, solidarity, and global finance and trade, to take just a few examples.
<br/><br/>
The Wilson Assistant Professorship will be awarded to a new scholar who shows early promise as an excellent university teacher and researcher. Wilson Fellows are required to attend all Wilson public functions and, during the course of their two-year term, organize at least one workshop on a topic to be negotiated with the Institute and forming the basis of a contribution to the Wilson Institute book series. Teaching responsibilities will be negotiated but will likely include involvement in the Wilson Institute’s undergraduate history course, “Making History,” which challenges students to participate actively in a central debate in Canadian history.
<br/><br/>
The successful applicant will be awarded a two year, contractually limited appointment to the Department of History beginning on 1 July 2017, and receive a minimum salary of $71,706 plus benefits. The salary in year two of the appointment will be a minimum of $74,707. The two-year appointment is not renewable. The applicant will receive a $5000.00 research and professional development allowance, and be eligible to apply for additional travel, research or publication funds from the Wilson Institute. Applicants must have received their PhD after 1 January 2014 or be scheduled to receive their PhD by 1 June 2017. Completed applications must include a covering letter, a CV, and two (2) letters of reference, including one from the dissertation advisor and some indication of the relationship of the candidate’s research to the mission of the Institute. Although applicants need not have any teaching experience, some evidence of teaching potential would be helpful.
<br/><br/>
Electronic applications and letters of reference will be accepted. All complete applications received before 30 April 2017 will be assured of consideration. Please send an additional electronic copy to wilsonch@mcmaster.ca

Our Approach</b></h3><p>
Education in Canada is a success story. Study after study shows that our public schools are among the best in the world. But high overall quality masks deep inequality. Only 48 percent of First Nations youth living on reserve have a high school diploma. In the North, those numbers are even lower. And, too often, teachers arrive in northern First Nations without the preparation and support they need to succeed—and stay—in the classroom. The twin challenges of teacher supply and turnover compound historical injustice and systemic inequities to produce a statistical education gap between First Nations and non-First Nations communities.</p><p></p><p><br/>
Teach For Canada is a non-profit organization that works with northern First Nations to recruit, prepare, and support committed teachers who will increase student outcomes in the North. This model has been defined by First Nations community partners, our Circle of Advisors, our Board of Directors, and experienced northern educators.</p><p></p><p><br/>
Teach For Canada is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to building a diverse and inclusive team. As an organization that works with First Nations, we value Indigenous perspectives in the workplace and strongly encourage Indigenous candidates to apply.</p><p></p><p><br/>
Teach For Canada welcomes and encourages applications from people with disabilities. Accommodations are available on request for candidates taking part in all aspects of the hiring process.</p><p><br/>

<p><b><br/> Our Approach</b></p>
<p> Education in Canada is a success story. Study after study shows that our public schools are among the best in the world. But high overall quality masks deep inequality. Only 48 percent of First Nations youth living on reserve have a high school diploma. In the North, those numbers are even lower. And, too often, teachers arrive in northern First Nations without the preparation and support they need to succeed—and stay—in the classroom. The twin challenges of teacher supply and turnover compound historical injustice and systemic inequities to produce a statistical education gap between First Nations and non-First Nations communities.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/> Teach For Canada is a non-profit organization that works with northern First Nations to recruit, prepare, and support committed teachers who will increase student outcomes in the North. This model has been defined by First Nations community partners, our Circle of Advisors, our Board of Directors, and experienced northern educators.</p>
<p></p>
<h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b><br/> Our Culture</b></h3>

In addition to these perks and benefits, Teach For Canada also honours National Indigenous Peoples Day and the National Day of Truth and Reconciliation as statutory holidays; and the last week of every calendar year is paid time off too!</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/> On our team, we are fortunate to have a committed, experienced, talented, and humble group of leaders. Together, this team works hard to create a meaningful impact. If you’re looking for a fast-paced, innovative, energizing, and rewarding work environment, then we want to hear from you!</p>

<h1 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> About MRU</b></h1>
<p>Founded in 1910 and located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Mount Royal University grew into a vibrant college in the 1930s and became a mid-sized university in 2009. Mount Royal has carved out a distinct niche by offering smaller class sizes, a robust liberal education and unique undergraduate programs. Currently, more than 15,000 credit students choose from 13 bachelor degrees and 38 majors.</p>
<p>Mount Royal University is located in the traditional territories of the Niitsitapi (Blackfoot) and the people of the Treaty 7 region in southern Alberta, which includes the Siksika, the Piikani, the Kainai, the Tsuut'ina and the Iyarhe Nakoda. We are situated on land where the Bow River meets the Elbow River. The traditional Blackfoot name of this place is ""Mohkinstsis,"" which we now call the city of Calgary. The city of Calgary is also home to the Métis Nation.</p>
<p>Mount Royal University is committed to removing barriers and fostering the inclusion of voices that have been historically underrepresented or discouraged in our society. In support of our belief that diversity in our faculty and staff enriches the work, learning and research experiences for the entire campus community, we strongly encourage members of the designated groups (women, Indigenous Peoples, persons with disabilities, members of visible minorities, and diverse sexual orientation and gender identities) to apply and self-identify.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<h1 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>About the Faculty of Arts</b></h1>
<p>The Faculty of Arts is home to six academic departments: Economics, Justice &amp; Policy Studies; English, Languages &amp; Cultures; Humanities; Interior Design; Psychology; and Sociology &amp; Anthropology. Arts currently offers the following degrees: Bachelor of Arts with six majors, Bachelor of Arts—Criminal Justice, and Bachelor of Interior Design.</p>
<p>The successful candidate will be a member of the Department of Humanities. The Department of Humanities currently offers a BA in History and a minor in Women’s and Gender Studies, as well as minors in Ancient and Medieval Studies, Art History, Canadian Studies, Humanities, Indigenous Studies, Linguistics, Philosophy, and Religious Studies.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<h1 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>About Women’s and Gender Studies</b></h1>
<p>Women's and Gender Studies (WGST) at MRU is committed to intersectional, anti-racist, and anti-oppressive pedagogies and to providing a brave learning space for students where they are encouraged to think critically, creatively, and self-reflexively in the pursuit of a more just world. We offer approximately 25 WGST courses each year to more than 850 undergraduate students registered in programs across campus. MRU offers a minor in WGST, and Women's and Gender Studies makes an important contribution to the university’s general education curriculum.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<h1 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>About the Role</b></h1>
<p>We invite applications for one position, subject to final budgetary approval, at the rank of either Assistant Professor or Associate Professor (hired with tenure is a possibility) with an anticipated start date of July 1, 2022 (negotiable). The successful candidate will be a teacher-scholar broadly trained in gender, women’s, sexuality, and/or feminist studies with expertise in field(s) that complement but do not duplicate those already represented. Fields of specialty are open, and the position will remain open until filled. We especially invite candidates who will strengthen our program’s commitment to social justice, anti-racist scholarship, and feminist technology, science, and/or health studies. We are also interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Environmental justice, including queer and gendered approaches</p> </li>
<li><p>Expertise in the areas of Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian, and/or other Women-of-Colour feminisms, including Indigeneity and critiques of settler colonialism</p> </li>
<li><p>The politics of the body, including health inequalities, transfeminism, and disability studies</p><br/> </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>WGST faculty value interdisciplinary teaching, scholarship, and experiential learning that further MRU’s commitment to diversity, equity, justice, and inclusive excellence. Preference will be given to candidates who demonstrate intersectional, innovative, community-engaged, and cross-disciplinary approaches to research and teaching within a liberal education context, and who value mentoring students who are first-generation, limited-income, and from historically underrepresented groups in post-secondary education.</p>
<p>New faculty at MRU are hired into one of two work patterns. The teaching/service pattern (TS) has a focus on teaching and service, and comes with a 4/4 teaching load. The teaching/scholarship/service pattern (TSS) has a focus on teaching and service, with the requirement that the faculty member also be involved in a research program, and comes with a 3/3 teaching load. Please indicate in your cover letter which of the two work patterns you would prefer; there is no preference for one over the other, and there is an option to change work patterns after tenure.</p>

185,Chief Development Officer,Aga Khan Museum,"Hybrid remote in Toronto, ON",https://ca.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=253bc6f6530c9936&fccid=99649c652cc5f3c0&vjs=3,"<div class=""jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"" id=""jobDescriptionText""><div><p>The Aga Khan Museum is a unique global museum located in Toronto, Canada, dedicated to showcasing the artistic, intellectual, and scientific heritage of Muslim civilizations and their interconnectedness with the world at large.</p>
<p>
Its mission is to foster a greater understanding and appreciation of the achievements and contributions of Muslim civilizations, fostering intercultural dialogue and pluralism through exhibitions, public programs, and educational initiatives onsite and online.</p>
<p>
Its opening in 2014 signalled a new chapter in the history of museums in North America as the first dedicated to the arts of Muslims civilizations. With its landmark building, designed by the Pritzker Prize–winning architect Fumihiko Maki, and its setting within the landscaped gardens of the Aga Khan Park, the Museum celebrates the arts in all its forms – from the visual to the performing arts.</p>
<p>
THE OPPORTUNITY<br/>
The Aga Khan Museum (AKM) is seeking a mission-driven, results-oriented, and collaborative Chief Development Officer (CDO) to provide strategic leadership and operational expertise for the fundraising efforts of the Museum to further advance its mission to foster greater understanding of Muslim civilizations, and to connect cultures through art.</p>
<p>
Reporting to the Museum’s Director and CEO, the CDO will be a member of, and contributor to, the Senior Leadership Team and will have active support from a strong network of global senior volunteers who serve on the Board of Directors and fundraising committees of the Museum.</p>
<p>
The CDO will be an accomplished and passionate fundraising professional who will champion and lead the growth and elevation of a sustainable fundraising plan targeted to raise $12-$15M annually, overseeing the management and cultivation of donors and sponsors, the identification and submission of grant applications to government agencies and foundations, the planning of fundraising, cultivation, and stewardship events, and the growth of the museum membership program. In addition to this, the planning and implementation of a multi-year $150M endowment campaign is one of the key deliverables of the position. For the purposes of context, currently 4,000 Museum supporters contribute approximately $9 million per annum. These include more than 30 donors who have donated above $0.5M.</p>
<p>
Carrying a personal portfolio of the Museum’s key donors and prospects in Canada and around the world, the CDO will be a fearless and highly proactive networker and fundraiser in their own right. The CDO will actively and frequently leverage key volunteers and board members in the identification, cultivation, and solicitation of donors, members, partners, and sponsors in Canada and abroad, in support of the Museum’s priorities.</p>
<p>
The CDO will be the primary staff lead for the Board’s Development and Fundraising Committee and will work closely with the Board of Directors of the Museum in all fundraising matters. As a skilled enabler of volunteers, the CDO will encourage and inspire volunteers to open doors and will provide support locally and internationally to maximize their passion, time, and connections most effectively.</p>
<p>
A role model who demonstrates inclusive leadership, collaboration, respect, and excellence, the CDO will harness the strengths of a Development team of 10, motivating the staff to new heights of achievement. Establishing clear goals and understanding the tactics and processes needed to achieve them, the CDO will engender confidence in, and enthusiasm for, the fundraising team’s efforts by demonstrating exceptional results.</p>
<p>
Passionate about equity and inclusion, the CDO will possess intercultural competence, understanding the unique nuances and perspectives of various cultures and expand support for the Museum through outreach and engagement with multiple communities in Canada and around the world.</p>
<p>
This is a permanent, full-time position and will be based in the Aga Khan Museum at 77 Wynford Drive, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. As of mid-April 2022 and for the rest of 2022, the museum will be working within a hybrid model with staff expected to be present in the office for a minimum of 3 days per week (with flexibility for donor-facing commitments and travel, of course). There will be significant travel in this role (regionally, nationally, and internationally) and candidates must possess a valid passport.</p>
<p>
ABOUT THE AGA KHAN MUSEUM<br/>
Honouring the spirit of collaboration and pluralism upon which the Museum is built, the Aga Khan Museum is deeply committed to both forging relationships with Canadian institutions and communities, and to driving an international mandate. It maintains strong global ties with such institutions as the Musée du Louvre in Paris, the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, and the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, Qatar.</p>
<p>
As a vibrant educational institution, the Museum encourages the full spectrum of public engagement with its diverse and distinguished Permanent Collection of more than 1,200 objects and its ever-changing roster of exhibitions and innovative public and educational programs onsite and online — including music and dance performances, talks, workshops, and a wide range of school and academic initiatives for students and teachers locally and around the world. By connecting cultures through the arts and fostering pluralism through the arts, the Aga Khan Museum is now reaching and impacting hundreds of thousands of people each year, in its Wynford site location in Toronto and through its virtual #Museum without Walls, which reached over 5M in 2021 alone. The new virtual Aga Khan Museum has emerged with a robust and compelling online presence, featuring virtual performances, 3D tours, educational and children’s programs. This ambitious virtual platform allows people from all over the world to access the resources and offerings of the Museum, while providing innovative and diverse opportunities for philanthropic giving.</p>
<p>
The Aga Khan Museum is part of the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN). Founded and chaired by His Highness the Aga Khan, the AKDN is a private, international, non-denominational development organization that works to improve living conditions and opportunities for people in the developing world. His Highness is the 49th hereditary Imam (spiritual leader) of the Shia Ismaili Muslims, and has received honourary citizenship from Canada.</p>
<p>
DEVELOPMENT AT THE AGA KHAN MUSEUM<br/>
The Aga Khan Museum relies on the generosity of donors and members in Canada and around the globe to sustain its vision of building bridges between cultures and fostering pluralism through the arts.</p>
<p>
Donations from individuals, corporations, government and foundation grants directly support the activities of the Aga Khan Museum, necessary to maintain our exceptional Permanent Collection and sustain its roster of exhibitions, public programs, performances, educational events and virtual Museum.</p>
<p>
His Highness the Aga Khan invested generously to construct the Museum and provide the Permanent Collection as an engine and launch pad for our intercultural art initiatives, and we continue to benefit from annual operating grants from the Aga Khan Foundation. While this solid base of support is critical for the Museum’s operations, the community plays an important role in supporting our ongoing efforts to build bridges and strengthen global community ties.</p>

<p>The team at The Heart is led by professionals with a vast knowledge across arts genres. We have music, visual art, and dance departments and two streams of educational programming: Traditional (Classical &amp; Royal Conservatory) and Contemporary (including the four elements of Hip Hop, improvisational jazz, &amp; funk).

We want our young dancers to connect with the world of breaking even though they live in a community far removed from the origins of the dance. We believe that hip hop/breaking culture has the ability to change the lives of our youth. This powerful genre gives many young men the ability to express themselves and the permission to dance. With no OG’s within 1000 miles, our program gives us the ability to train young dancers in a studio environment, in a way that YouTube just cannot do.</p>

The professionals managing these transactions work just as they did twenty years ago, relying on little more than email and spreadsheets. At Altrio, we're bringing real estate investing online and building technology solutions that help the world’s leading real estate investors move faster and more confidently than their competitors. Our first product, Origin, has been adopted by some of the world’s largest and most respected investment companies, including two of the three largest investors in the world.</p>
<p><b>What you will do:</b></p><ul>
<li><b>Onboard new clients to our platform; U</b>nlike many other startups, our clients are still managing their data predominantly in spreadsheets and offline formats. Onboarding them to our platform requires you to have a good understanding of the industry, underwriting and modeling, and/or data management so you can configure and customize our platform to meet their needs with the information they have. There is no one-size-fits-all solution with our platform, so you’ll need to be an expert at quickly understanding variable needs from our clients and how to configure our system accordingly. A major part of being successful in this outcome is being able to ask great questions of our clients so you can quickly understand the needs of their business, and what is possible based on the information they are giving you. You will work closely with our VP, Enterprise Customer Success, Onboarding Lead, and Data Team to support our strategic accounts in onboarding through designing and configuring Origin to support their initial use cases.</li>
<li><b>Facilitate adoption and drive retention;</b> once our clients are successfully onboarded, you will make sure that they are getting value from the product. Managing our current onboarded clients is one of the biggest opportunities we have in the CS department. You will work in tandem with the account owner to ensure our clients are continuously finding more value from the product in their work. This could be accomplished through 1:1 calls, proactive outreach, and/or reviewing materials/training larger groups of users. You will educate customers on how to best achieve outcomes in our platform, while also assisting them in processing data, designing and building reports, training users, and more. You will help inform how we enhance our product based on your intimate knowledge of our clients.
</li><li><b>Facilitate client feedback and expansion into new use cases;</b> You will gather feedback regularly from our clients and ensure this feedback filters through the rest of our organization appropriately. You will be the first to identify opportunities with clients and/or risks that may prevent people from getting the most out of the product. You will answer support tickets, but your ultimate goal is to identify potential problems before they occur and build proactive solutions including documentation, videos, tutorials, and outbound communications. You will help roll-out new features to our current clients and work to expand those using the platform, when this adds value to an organization.
</li><li><b>Better the CS department;</b> As a new startup, there are endless opportunities to add value internally to our department. Some include helping build out our education centre with webinars, tutorials and training, or helping create internal best-practices that allow us to deliver more value to our clients. Internally, the opportunities are endless and we’re hoping you surprise us with your ability to add value across the business in different ways.<br/>
</li></ul><p><br/>
<b>Who you are</b></p><ul><br/>
<li><b>Great communicator with high EQ;</b> The majority of your role will be spent working with our clients. You are someone who finds energy in speaking with others all day long. You understand that great communication also means listening; you are able to make our clients feel heard. You’re known amongst others as a patient teacher and facilitator who works hard to go the extra mile for your clients.
</li><li><b>Confident working with data: </b>You are data driven by nature and are comfortable dealing with data, processing data, designing data structures/tables, etc. Our customers use large amounts of data to underwrite and model their investment outcomes. We support these activities through our platform. It is critical that you feel confident and comfortable interpreting non-standardized data and translating that into a structured and standardized data model for storing information in Origin.</li>
<li><b>Strong project manager;</b> You have a history of delivering on projects end-to-end. You know how to deliver work regardless of what bumps get in the way. You can hold customers accountable to their deliverables to meet timelines, and know how to influence internal stakeholders to ensure our deadlines are met. You’re meticulous in how you plan, organize, track and monitor projects.
</li><li><b>You’re an ambitious problem-solver;</b> You like working hard to solve challenges and are happy to go looking for answers when they might not be obvious to you. You’re comfortable being one of the first members on a team and continuously working to improve our business and your function.
</li><li><b>You come from a work background that has a combination of:</b> working in real estate/finance, proptech, data management, SAAS, customer success, project implementation, client onboarding - Or none of these, but have read the job posting and feel like you’re the absolute perfect fit and are willing to tell us why!<br/>
</li></ul><p></p><br/>
<p><b>Why Work With Us</b></p>
<p>In addition to a competitive salary and access to a health spending account, Altrio believes in generous personal leave and provides four weeks vacation. As an early member of the customer success team, you will experience incredible opportunities for growth alongside our business as we continue to evolve. You’ll be joining at the early stages of a startup with an equity grant to align your growth potential with that of the organization. You’ll be doing the hands-on work to find out what makes our client’s successful and helping us learn and introduce new functionality. You’ll work closely with all functions within the organization giving you business oversight in a way other roles may not.

<p>Experience why the world loves Canada! Affordability, adventure, friendly people, universal healthcare and beautiful scenery. Also, we have hobnobs!</p>
<p><b>The Practice</b><br/> Only 6% of hospitals in Canada are accredited by the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA), and our 4 veterinarian, companion animal hospital is one of them. We celebrate best practices and are not shy to try new things, most recently introducing stem cell therapy and digital thermal imaging to our roster. Our vets work alongside our 7 Registered Veterinary Technicians (veterinary nurses) and, together with our other support team members, we run a busy and successful hospital. We use cloud-based software (Ezy-Vet) and our nearest referral centre is conveniently located within the Ontario Veterinary College. Our building has served us well for many years but we are currently in the planning stages for construction of a new hospital – something to look forward to!</p>
<p><b>The Role</b></p>
<p>Being an AAHA-Accredited practice means we are constantly striving to be better, with clear protocols and progressive culture. With a fear-free mindset and emphasis on client relationships, we are lucky to have a compliant client base that benefits from our extensive scope of services.</p>
<p>Our veterinarians work collaboratively and have regular doctor’s meetings to ensure consistency and open communication. In support of your medicine, you will have an in-house lab, digital x-ray, therapeutic laser and ultrasound available. Along with theriogenology, rehabilitation and chiropractic services in-house, one of our vets rounds out our Western medicine with Traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture for the times when your clients wish to pursue these methodologies.</p>
<p>You will be scheduled for 36-40 hours over 4 days as well as working one in four Saturday shifts. There will be a mix of appointments and surgeries. Each of our veterinarians is responsible for one on-call shift every 4-6 weeks as part of a rotating call system shared within our community.</p>
<p><b>Successful Candidate</b></p>
<p>Our ideal candidate takes pride in their leadership and communication abilities. Although a minimum of 2 years of experience is preferred, a newer graduate with a high level of proficiency would be considered. If you show up with a can-do attitude and a love of surgery and medicine, we’ll set you up for success. For the right individual, we would absolutely consider the possibility of buy-in. Either way, it’s incredibly important to us that you have a voice and take an active role in the evolution of our hospital, because it will be <i>your </i>hospital too.</p>
<p>Ideally you like to be organized and are diligent about record keeping and timeliness. You are team-oriented, kind-hearted and passionate about helping people and their pets. Should you be interested, mentorship in Chinese medicine, acupuncture, Vet Stem, rehab or reproductive services would be available to you. Our Dr. Boyd is marvellous, and a wonderful teacher!</p>
<p>You clicked on our ad so you must have a sense of humour! We do have hobnobs (we didn’t always!), but that’s not really why you should consider moving. Canada celebrates diversity, culture, equity, the arts, sports and adventure. You will be free to authentically be yourself and feel welcomed into our community with open arms and hearts.</p>
<p>Moving from the UK to Canada has the appeal of travel and adventure, without the drawbacks of language barriers or disorienting culture shock. The rumours are true, we do say “eh?” and apologize often, but we think that just adds to our charm! Canada is a peaceful country and, Owen Sound is a perfect mix of rural and urban. It is only a 2-hour (scenic) drive from the big city of Toronto (with direct flights to the UK) and, the largest urban community in its county (with all of the amenities including the regional hospital). Owen Sound boasts incredible value for money with property and housing being readily available and affordable. It is the type of place that allows you to live on an acreage and still be at work in 10 minutes! Located on the southern shore of Georgian Bay it has an expansive harbour, waterfalls, ski hills and parks. First settled in 1841, the thriving downtown core is steeped in history (for Canada!!) – giving it a truly village ambiance.</p>
<p><b>The Package</b></p>
<p>We value veterinarians, and prove it by supporting your personal, financial, and professional growth through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuing Education (CE);</li>
<li>Above average salary;</li>
<li>A comprehensive Health Benefits package (100% of extended Medical &amp; Dental premiums paid for things not covered under our publicly-funded healthcare);</li>
<li>Professional Services coverage (chiropractor, massage therapist, physiotherapist, vision, etc.);</li>
<li>Employee Assistance Program;</li>
<li>Paid Licensing &amp; Membership Dues;</li>
<li>Professional Liability Insurance coverage;</li>
<li>Paid Vacation time;</li>
<li>Paid Sick &amp; Personal Days;</li>
<li>Generous Veterinary Discounts (75% off services for your own pets, and an extended family and friends discount);</li>
<li>Uniform Allowance</li>
<li>Eligibility for a discretionary Performance Bonus</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, in order to facilitate your successful transition, we would provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relocation Assistance</li>
<li>Comprehensive Immigration Assistance</li>
<li>Hospital will procure Labour Market Impact Assessment in concert with Immigration Lawyer (on retainer) to secure Temporary Foreign Worker Permit. Then, Immigration Lawyer will be retained for Permanent Residency conversion process.</li>

<p><b>What do we teach?</b></p>
<p> We adapt both our global curriculum and local approach to the technical trends and hiring environment of the times and cities we work in, but today our primary educational approach centers around JavaScript. In general, our curriculum is scaffolded to follow the historical evolution of software engineering. We start by teaching the fundamentals of programming and web design through JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. About 25% of our course (normally unit 2 of 4) focuses on Rails MVC or similar framework, using that context to introduce databases, security, and other foundational knowledge. The rest of the course (units 3 and 4) focuses back on JavaScript. We cover API development in Node, then tackle one or more front-end MV* frameworks (Backbone, Angular, Ember, React). We also cover all sorts of other things that junior web developers need to know, like source control, team collaboration, and developer workflow.</p>
<p> We give students the chance to spend focused time building at least 4 major projects, in addition to other smaller projects and labs. About 20% of overall class time is spent on dedicated project work.</p>

<p>The Seabird Island Band is a multi-faceted First Nations Band that includes government, business, service, and nonprofit services. We work as an integrated team to improve the health, education, and economic opportunities for First Nations people to create thriving First Nations families and communities.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/> Position Summary:</b></p>
<p> The start date of this position is August 29, 2022 and will end June 30, 2023. This position involves the provision of instruction to students of Seabird Island Community School/High School and includes instruction, preparation, assessment, classroom management, professional development and school meetings, community and parental relations and adherence to all Seabird Island Community School and BC Ministry of Education policies and procedures.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i><br/> Seabird Island Band is committed to the health and safety of its employee's and community members. SIB has implemented measures to protect and prevent the spread of COVID-19. SIB is mandated under provincial health care standards that all employees provide proof of vaccination for COVID-19 unless otherwise deemed exempt under the Human Rights Code</i></p>
<p><br/> <b> First Peoples Principles of Learning</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Learning ultimately supports the well-being of the self, the family, the community, the land, the spirits, and the ancestors.<br/> </li>
<li>Learning is holistic, reflexive, reflective, experiential, and relational (focused on connectedness, on reciprocal relationships, and a sense of place).<br/> </li>
<li>Learning involves recognizing the consequences of one’s actions.<br/> </li>
<li>Learning involves generational roles and responsibilities.<br/> </li>
<li>Learning recognizes the role of indigenous knowledge.<br/> </li>
<li>Learning is embedded in memory, history, and story.<br/> </li>
<li>Learning involves patience and time.<br/> </li>
<li>Learning requires exploration of one’s identity.<br/> </li>
<li>Learning involves recognizing that some knowledge is sacred and only shared with permission and/or in certain situations.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p> The Grade 5 Teacher is expected to value Indigenous ways of knowing and be willing to be guided by the recognition of ways of learning inherent within First Nations’ worldviews. The 9 First Peoples Principles of Learning must form an integral part of planning and delivering lessons. The lessons must be learner centred, inquiry based, prioritize experiential learning, emphasize an awareness of self and others equally, value collaborative learning and support a variety of learning styles. Prepared lessons and activities should help students develop their unique self-knowledge as well as knowledge and understanding of recurring themes in the world view of many First Nations including connections to land and environment, spirit and spirituality, sustainability and continuity, story and identity as well as the significance of oral tradition. The Grade 5 Teacher believes that all students can learn and understands that she/he is leading students through a very critical transition in their academic and social lives. The students are on the cusp of high school and expectations around being more focused, organized, independent and responsible are consistently increasing. The Teacher is a guide during this turbulent time and helps students learn to manage themselves so that they do not become overwhelmed. Emphasizing personalized learning and providing flexibility in terms of the variety of ways in which students can show what they know is expected. It is also expected that the Grade 5 Teacher will move students forward in their understanding of social and personal responsibilities.</p>
<p><br/> In terms of year plans, which are due to the principal every year at the end of September, an overarching guiding question that permeates it should be, am I teaching students to think? If so, where is the evidence of that in my planning? We are no longer looking simply at the quantity of content that is being covered, instead the destination is having students arrive at evidence of their own authentic, sophisticated thinking. Content is a vehicle that can get them there. Looking at the revised B.C. curriculum it is important to keep in mind that the goal is to create learning that prepares students for the 21st century and this means a great deal of focus on helping our students become critical, creative and collaborative thinkers. A key word used to explain this goal for our students is adaptability. Tom Schimmer is constantly asking us as teachers to maximize our students’ possibilities for adaptability. Some important questions to consider are as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><br/> Are the First Nations Principles of Learning explicit in my planning?</li>
<li>Are curricular and core competencies explicitly stated and connected to assessment?</li>
<li>Are cross curricular connections clearly outlined?</li>
<li>How will I know that the students have grasped the core competencies and what will I do if they don’t?</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p><b> Qualifications/Requirements:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Bachelors in Education<br/> </li>
<li>Must be a BC Certified Teacher.<br/> </li>
<li>Possess knowledge and understanding in concepts of First Nations ways of knowing/learning and current events pertaining to the instruction of grade 6 students.<br/> </li>
<li>2-3 years’ experience in a similar role is preferred.<br/> </li>
<li>Standard First Aid and CPR certification is considered an asset.<br/> </li>
<li>Possess strong leadership, public-speaking, and classroom management skills in order to successfully instruct students in the manner in which they should do particular activities.</li>
<li>Proficient computer skills including Microsoft Office Applications (Word, Excel, Internet, and Email).<br/> </li>
<li>Excellent verbal and written communication skills.<br/> </li>
<li>Ability to adhere to Oath of Confidentiality and Seabird Island Band Policies and Procedure.<br/> </li>
<li>Knowledge, respect and understanding of Stó:lō culture, traditions and language is considered an asset.<br/> </li>
<li>Experience working with First Nations community and children is considered an asset.<br/> </li>

<b>Report to:</b> Program Director, Educo Adventure School
<br/><br/>
<b>THE ROLE:</b><br/>
JUMP! Canada is looking for dynamic, passionate, and hardworking Facilitators to deliver transformational, fun, and safe courses for youth in our Adventure School and Community programs this summer.
<br/><br/>
<b>THE JUMP! CANADA AND EDUCO APPROACH:</b><br/>
Educo Adventure School operated by JUMP! Canada aims to be more than just an outdoor classroom: we seek to create meaningful experiences that draw forth our students’ emotional, social, and spiritual development. We believe this is fostered through deepening connections with the natural world, embracing challenge, and learning the intricacies of intimate teamwork. We learn experientially – hands-on! Educo offers opportunities for young people to disconnect from the digital and online arenas and to cultivate a sense of belonging in the world as they journey through our local mountains, forests, lakes, and rivers. Educo Adventure School staff facilitate opportunities for youth to become self-aware and engaged with the people, communities, and natural world surrounding them.
<br/><br/>
<b>JUMP! CANADA AND EDUCO CULTURE:</b><br/>
The Educo Adventure School has a rich history in youth work and community living. In a loving and supportive environment, we encourage each other to step beyond our preconceived limitations and to express ourselves fully and creatively. As a staff team, we work hard (and play harder). We work collaboratively and we value one another’s contributions. We ask of our staff what we ask of our students: a willingness to step beyond our comfort zone and to practice vulnerability and appreciation. If you prefer efficiency to collaboration, dislike ambiguity, and adhere to a very strict schedule, then leading at Educo Adventure School probably isn’t right for you. If you’re looking for a fun, multifaceted, and rewarding work environment that will push you every single day, then we want to hear from you!

<p> If you are looking to make a life-changing impact by sharing your love for software development with the next generation of developers, we'd love for you to consider joining our team. We deliver more than just skills training, and are looking for teachers who share our vision for a community of lifelong learners pursuing work that they love.

<p><b>What do we teach?</b></p>
<p> We adapt both our global curriculum and local approach to the technical trends and hiring environment of the times and cities we work in, but today our primary educational approach centers around JavaScript. In general, our curriculum is scaffolded to follow the historical evolution of software engineering. We start by teaching the fundamentals of programming and web design through JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. About 25% of our course (normally unit 2 of 4) focuses on Rails MVC or similar framework, using that context to introduce databases, security, and other foundational knowledge. The rest of the course (units 3 and 4) focuses back on JavaScript. We cover API development in Node, then tackle one or more front-end MV* frameworks (Backbone, Angular, Ember, React). We also cover all sorts of other things that junior web developers need to know, like source control, team collaboration, and developer workflow.</p>
<p> We give students the chance to spend focused time building at least 4 major projects, in addition to other smaller projects and labs. About 20% of overall class time is spent on dedicated project work.</p>

<p><b>Employment period (8 weeks): July 4-August 26 (Monday-Friday, 9am-4pm)</b></p>
<p>There’s nothing more satisfying than knowing that you are responsible for the smiles and sheer joy that campers will get from being at camp with you. There is no better place to combine the wonderful responsibility of being a positive role model to kids, have the most fun ever and learn the invaluable skills of leadership, problem solving, effective communication and teamwork. This all happens in an amazingly positive environment where you will receive pre-camp and ongoing training/support from camp professionals who have been doing this for decades.</p>
<p>Positions We're Hiring For:</p>
<p><b>Group Counsellor: </b> Working in a team to safely supervise and lead activities for groups of campers organized by age. Campers range in age from 4-13.</p>
<p><b>Activity Counsellor: </b> Planning activities and teaching campers skills in one of our activity areas. e.g. Archery, Canoe, Low Ropes, Drama, Sports etc.</p>
<p><b>Sports Academy Counsellor: </b> Supervising and instructing sports for boys and girls ages 6-13 years-old.</p>
<p><b>About Camp Robin Hood: </b></p>
<p>Our family owned and operated environment has been a leader in day camp programs for 75 years, boasting a long, exciting history. We have a very unique environment that is only a short drive from downtown Toronto, but feels like we are at overnight camp located hours away from the city. It’s also one of the only places where children and staff with special needs are fully integrated into the program.</p>
<p>Here, many of our former staff gained their first experience working with children who have special needs, helping them choose future careers in fields like: teaching, therapy, educational assistant, support worker and more.</p>
<p>If making money is a top priority, you will be better off planting trees, working in a factory, labouring on a construction site or serving in a restaurant with a reputation for big tippers. A counsellor’s job has many non-monetary benefits: enjoying the outdoors, working with old and new friends, access to camp activities, the satisfaction of teaching and learning from the campers and knowing that you made a difference in the lives of children in your care.</p>
<p>We also know that the full range of skills you will develop and enhance at camp will serve you well in what ever field of work you choose to do in the future. And when the day comes that you need to commit to a job that requires your presence 50 weeks a year, you will discover that the characteristics and skills honed at camp are very marketable: your patience, perseverance, flexibility and creativity and your ability to lead, to communicate, to be a team member and to relate to all kinds of people. Many university and graduate programs look favourably on people with camp experience. This work looks great on a resume!</p>
<p>Camp Directors also write many reference letters for former staff aspiring to be teachers, doctors, lawyers or leaders in business. The skills learned at camp will positively influence your success at school, at work and in personal relationships for the rest of your life. What better preparation for parenthood is there than being a camp counsellor?</p>

<p> If you are looking to make a life-changing impact by sharing your love for software development with the next generation of developers, we’d love for you to consider joining our team. We deliver more than just skills training, and are looking for teachers who share our vision for a community of lifelong learners pursuing work that they love. As a full-time teacher for our flagship full-time web development program, you will join us on one of our many campuses to:</p>

<p><b>What do we teach?</b></p>
<p> We adapt both our global curriculum and local approach to the technical trends and hiring environment of the times and cities we work in, but today our primary educational approach centers around JavaScript.

We start by teaching the fundamentals of programming and web design through JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. About 25% of our course (normally unit 2 of 4) focuses on Rails MVC or similar framework, using that context to introduce databases, security, and other foundational knowledge. The rest of the course (units 3 and 4) focuses back on JavaScript. We cover API development in Node, then tackle one or more front-end MV* frameworks (Backbone, Angular, Ember, React). We also cover all sorts of other things that junior web developers need to know, like source control, team collaboration, and developer workflow.</p>
<p> We give students the chance to spend focused time building at least 4 major projects, in addition to other smaller projects and labs. About 20% of overall class time is spent on dedicated project work.</p>

</ul>

<p> If you are looking to make a life-changing impact by sharing your love for software development with the next generation of developers, we'd love for you to consider joining our team. We deliver more than just skills training, and are looking for teachers who share our vision for a community of lifelong learners pursuing work that they love.

<p><b>What do we teach?</b></p>
<p> We adapt both our global curriculum and local approach to the technical trends and hiring environment of the times and cities we work in, but today our primary educational approach centers around JavaScript. In general, our curriculum is scaffolded to follow the historical evolution of software engineering. We start by teaching the fundamentals of programming and web design through JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. About 25% of our course (normally unit 2 of 4) focuses on Rails MVC or similar framework, using that context to introduce databases, security, and other foundational knowledge. The rest of the course (units 3 and 4) focuses back on JavaScript. We cover API development in Node, then tackle one or more front-end MV* frameworks (Backbone, Angular, Ember, React). We also cover all sorts of other things that junior web developers need to know, like source control, team collaboration, and developer workflow.</p>
<p> We give students the chance to spend focused time building at least 4 major projects, in addition to other smaller projects and labs. About 20% of overall class time is spent on dedicated project work.</p>

Ample opportunities to explore the territory by snowmobile, ATV, snow shoes, kayak, and even sled from time to time.</p><p>The perks of being semi-isolated: pure water, clean air, peace and quiet, bright stars and Northern Lights, all four seasons, and the opportunity to live and learn on this land with the Dak’elh people who have thrived here since time immemorial</p><p>The people of Yekooche value their land, language, culture and history.

Neh gaaw saga'igan is the local translation of Sandy Lake, where the people traditionally and continues to live off the abundance of land as hunters and gatherers.

Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Statement
<br/><br/>
The York Region District School Board (YRDSB) believes in giving each and every applicant an equal opportunity to succeed on their own merit and we strive to hire staff that reflect and support the diverse perspectives, experiences and needs of our students and our communities. We remain committed to upholding the values of equity, diversity, and inclusion in our living, learning and work environments. We know that diversity underpins excellence, and that we all share responsibility for creating an equitable, diverse and inclusive Board-community. Therefore, in pursuit of our values, we seek members who will work respectfully and constructively with differences and across the organizational hierarchy in actualizing the Board’s priorities, goals and principles outlined in the Director’s Action Plan.
<br/><br/>
We actively encourage applications from members of groups with historical and/or current barriers to equity, including, but not limited to:
<br/><br/>
First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples, and all other Indigenous peoples;
<br/><br/>
African, Black and Black Caribbean peoples (in alignment with Anti-Black Racism Strategy);
<br/><br/>
members of groups that commonly experience discrimination due to race, ancestry, colour, religion and/or spiritual beliefs, or place of origin;
<br/><br/>
persons with visible and/or invisible (physical and/or mental) disabilities;
<br/><br/>
persons who identify as women; and
<br/><br/>
persons of marginalized sexual orientations, gender identities, and gender expressions.
<br/><br/>
At YRDSB, we recognize that many of these identities intersect and therefore, equity, diversity and inclusion can be complex. We value and respect the contributions that each person brings to enriching the Board and are committed to ensuring full and equal participation for all in communities that we serve.
<br/><br/>

<p>
Neh gaaw saga'igan is the local translation of Sandy Lake, where the people traditionally and continues to live off the abundance of land as hunters and gatherers. Though wild game is still a staple in the diets of many, today the people of Sandy Lake enjoy games and sports such as hockey, volleyball, softball, taekwondo, golf, and other modern sports.
</p><p>Located 450 km northeast of Winnipeg and 600 km northwest of Thunder Bay, we are a remote, fly-in First Nation community located in the boreal forested area of Northwestern Ontario along the Severn River. Beautiful landscapes surround our community, giving our people the opportunity for outdoor and social activities all-year-round. In the summer, we go hunting, hiking, kayaking, and fishing. In the winter, we go ice fishing, play ice hockey, and marvel at the beautiful northern lights above our open skies. Getting in and out of Sandy Lake is very convenient, with daily flights chartered by <b>Wasay</b><b>a Airways</b> and <b>Perimeter Aviations</b>, from multiple cities and towns in Winnipeg and Ontario.</p><p><br/>

Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Statement
<br/><br/>
The York Region District School Board (YRDSB) believes in giving each and every applicant an equal opportunity to succeed on their own merit and we strive to hire staff that reflect and support the diverse perspectives, experiences and needs of our students and our communities. We remain committed to upholding the values of equity, diversity, and inclusion in our living, learning and work environments. We know that diversity underpins excellence, and that we all share responsibility for creating an equitable, diverse and inclusive Board-community. Therefore, in pursuit of our values, we seek members who will work respectfully and constructively with differences and across the organizational hierarchy in actualizing the Board’s priorities, goals and principles outlined in the Director’s Action Plan.
<br/><br/>
We actively encourage applications from members of groups with historical and/or current barriers to equity, including, but not limited to:
<br/><br/>
First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples, and all other Indigenous peoples;
<br/><br/>
African, Black and Black Caribbean peoples (in alignment with Anti-Black Racism Strategy);
<br/><br/>
members of groups that commonly experience discrimination due to race, ancestry, colour, religion and/or spiritual beliefs, or place of origin;
<br/><br/>
persons with visible and/or invisible (physical and/or mental) disabilities;
<br/><br/>
persons who identify as women; and
<br/><br/>
persons of marginalized sexual orientations, gender identities, and gender expressions.
<br/><br/>
At YRDSB, we recognize that many of these identities intersect and therefore, equity, diversity and inclusion can be complex. We value and respect the contributions that each person brings to enriching the Board and are committed to ensuring full and equal participation for all in communities that we serve.
<br/><br/>

</p><p><b>ENVS 2113A </b>Ecological Literacy, THURSDAYS 2:30 PM – 5:20 PM
</p><p>This course introduces students to key ecological concepts through the study of the Grand Lake
</p><p>Lowlands ecoregion where Fredericton is located, including its biodiversity and ecosystems, the
</p><p>flow of materials, energy and waste from the ecosystem through human systems and back again,
</p><p>and the implications of these flows for sustainability. As they become acquainted with the local
</p><p>ecoregion, students will also explore the literary tradition of nature writing in which writers infuse
</p><p>their intense observations of local natural history with ethical reflections on being an inhabitant,
</p><p>rather than simply a resident, of a place.
</p><p></p><p>St. Thomas University is an undergraduate, liberal arts institution with a full-time enrolment of
</p><p>1,900. Its students graduate with Bachelor of Arts, Applied Arts, Education, and Social Work
</p><p>degrees. The faculty members are distinguished teachers, researchers and scholars, and the
</p><p>university holds two Canada Research Chairs.
</p><p></p><p>A PhD, or imminent completion is preferred; a Master’s degree is required. Each applicant is to
</p><p>submit a curriculum vitae, evidence of teaching effectiveness (teaching portfolio preferred), and
</p><p>arrange to have three letters of reference sent directly to Dr. Janice Harvey, Subject Coordinator
</p><p>for Environment and Society, St. Thomas University, Fredericton, NB E3B 5G3. Electronic
</p><p>applications may be sent to jeharvey@stu.ca.

Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Statement
<br/><br/>
The York Region District School Board (YRDSB) believes in giving each and every applicant an equal opportunity to succeed on their own merit and we strive to hire staff that reflect and support the diverse perspectives, experiences and needs of our students and our communities. We remain committed to upholding the values of equity, diversity, and inclusion in our living, learning and work environments. We know that diversity underpins excellence, and that we all share responsibility for creating an equitable, diverse and inclusive Board-community. Therefore, in pursuit of our values, we seek members who will work respectfully and constructively with differences and across the organizational hierarchy in actualizing the Board’s priorities, goals and principles outlined in the Director’s Action Plan.
<br/><br/>
We actively encourage applications from members of groups with historical and/or current barriers to equity, including, but not limited to:
<br/><br/>
First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples, and all other Indigenous peoples;
<br/><br/>
African, Black and Black Caribbean peoples (in alignment with Anti-Black Racism Strategy);
<br/><br/>
members of groups that commonly experience discrimination due to race, ancestry, colour, religion and/or spiritual beliefs, or place of origin;
<br/><br/>
persons with visible and/or invisible (physical and/or mental) disabilities;
<br/><br/>
persons who identify as women; and
<br/><br/>
persons of marginalized sexual orientations, gender identities, and gender expressions.
<br/><br/>
At YRDSB, we recognize that many of these identities intersect and therefore, equity, diversity and inclusion can be complex. We value and respect the contributions that each person brings to enriching the Board and are committed to ensuring full and equal participation for all in communities that we serve.
<br/><br/>

Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Statement
<br/><br/>
The York Region District School Board (YRDSB) believes in giving each and every applicant an equal opportunity to succeed on their own merit and we strive to hire staff that reflect and support the diverse perspectives, experiences and needs of our students and our communities. We remain committed to upholding the values of equity, diversity, and inclusion in our living, learning and work environments. We know that diversity underpins excellence, and that we all share responsibility for creating an equitable, diverse and inclusive Board-community. Therefore, in pursuit of our values, we seek members who will work respectfully and constructively with differences and across the organizational hierarchy in actualizing the Board’s priorities, goals and principles outlined in the Director’s Action Plan.
<br/><br/>
We actively encourage applications from members of groups with historical and/or current barriers to equity, including, but not limited to:
<br/><br/>
First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples, and all other Indigenous peoples;
<br/><br/>
African, Black and Black Caribbean peoples (in alignment with Anti-Black Racism Strategy);
<br/><br/>
members of groups that commonly experience discrimination due to race, ancestry, colour, religion and/or spiritual beliefs, or place of origin;
<br/><br/>
persons with visible and/or invisible (physical and/or mental) disabilities;
<br/><br/>
persons who identify as women; and
<br/><br/>
persons of marginalized sexual orientations, gender identities, and gender expressions.
<br/><br/>
At YRDSB, we recognize that many of these identities intersect and therefore, equity, diversity and inclusion can be complex. We value and respect the contributions that each person brings to enriching the Board and are committed to ensuring full and equal participation for all in communities that we serve.
<br/><br/>

Most of our band members live in Reserve #3 (Yekooche) located along the northwest arm of Stuart Lake, where Nan’cut Creek drains Cunningham Lake into Stuart Lake.</p><p>Do you love the outdoors? Our territory abounds with opportunities for hunting, fishing, ice fishing, trapping and living off the land. We share this land with bears, moose, rabbits, grouse, porcupines, beaver, salmon, and eagles, many varieties of berries, as well as herbs and medicines. Ample opportunities to explore the territory by snowmobile, ATV, snow shoes, kayak, and even sled from time to time.</p><p>The perks of being semi-isolated: pure water, clean air, peace and quiet, bright stars and Northern Lights, all four seasons, and the opportunity to live and learn on this land with the Dak’elh people who have thrived here since time immemorial</p><p>The people of Yekooche value their land, language, culture and history. You will be welcomed into the community where you will discover the peoples’ strong sense of tradition – as well as their sense of humour: teasing means we like you! If hunting isn’t your thing, you will be able to fully immerse yourself in story-telling, singing, dancing, and drumming.</p><p>We have approx. 200 members, and about half live in Yekooche.</p><p>Yekooche is a 1.25 hour drive on a logging road from Fort St. James and about 3 hours from Prince George.</p><p>See http://www.yekooche.com/ for more information.</p><p><b>Are You the Teacher We’re Looking For?</b></p><p>Yekooche First Nation’s vision for its students is that they leave school with the ability to walk in two worlds; we need to prepare them to have a positive impact in their own community as well as out into the broader world.</p><p>The children of Yekooche First Nation need to be deeply rooted in their land, language and culture AND they need the skills, knowledge, and understandings that will allow them to access all areas of the broader Canadian and global society.</p><p><b>These are the important questions for us: </b></p><ul><li>Do you believe all students can learn to high levels? What does that statement mean to you?</li><li>Is it academics OR whole child? Or is it academics AND whole child?</li><li>How to use the BC Curriculum to overcome the historic damage and systemic barriers the Western educational model has imposed on our people?</li><li>How to move beyond remediation? How to accelerate?</li><li>Learning is reciprocal. You don’t need to know the Dak’elh language, or how to tan a moose hide – you just need to be willing and eager to learn – we will learn from each other.</li><li>Does this vision and do these questions resonate with you? Are you the one we are looking for to join us in pursuing that vision?</li></ul><p><b>Primary Qualifications</b></p><p>First and foremost we are looking for an idealistic and joyful educator who feels alignment with our vision for our children’s education.</p><p>If you are a BC certified teacher AND our vision for our students resonates with you, we want to talk with you.</p><p>Our school population is ~20, allowing for very small teacher to student ratios and therefore more focused attention to address the needs of our students. We emphasize language and culture throughout the school day, and are seeking educators who are eager to learn more about our traditions. We are also looking for teachers who hold high expectations for students, are sensitive to the historic damage and systemic racism inflicted on our people, and who believe in educating the whole child.

<p>
Neh gaaw saga'igan is the local translation of Sandy Lake, where the people traditionally and continues to live off the abundance of land as hunters and gatherers. Though wild game is still a staple in the diets of many, today the people of Sandy Lake enjoy games and sports such as hockey, volleyball, softball, taekwondo, golf, and other modern sports.

In the winter, we go ice fishing, play ice hockey, and marvel at the beautiful northern lights above our open skies.

Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Statement
<br/><br/>
The York Region District School Board (YRDSB) believes in giving each and every applicant an equal opportunity to succeed on their own merit and we strive to hire staff that reflect and support the diverse perspectives, experiences and needs of our students and our communities. We remain committed to upholding the values of equity, diversity, and inclusion in our living, learning and work environments. We know that diversity underpins excellence, and that we all share responsibility for creating an equitable, diverse and inclusive Board-community. Therefore, in pursuit of our values, we seek members who will work respectfully and constructively with differences and across the organizational hierarchy in actualizing the Board’s priorities, goals and principles outlined in the Director’s Action Plan.

persons who identify as women; and
<br/><br/>
persons of marginalized sexual orientations, gender identities, and gender expressions.

At YRDSB, we recognize that many of these identities intersect and therefore, equity, diversity and inclusion can be complex.

</p><p></p><p>Semester 1: (September to December 2022)
</p><p><b>ENVS 2113A </b>Ecological Literacy, THURSDAYS 2:30 PM – 5:20 PM
</p><p>This course introduces students to key ecological concepts through the study of the Grand Lake
</p><p>Lowlands ecoregion where Fredericton is located, including its biodiversity and ecosystems, the
</p><p>flow of materials, energy and waste from the ecosystem through human systems and back again,
</p><p>and the implications of these flows for sustainability. As they become acquainted with the local
</p><p>ecoregion, students will also explore the literary tradition of nature writing in which writers infuse
</p><p>their intense observations of local natural history with ethical reflections on being an inhabitant,
</p><p>rather than simply a resident, of a place.
</p><p></p><p>St. Thomas University is an undergraduate, liberal arts institution with a full-time enrolment of
</p><p>1,900. Its students graduate with Bachelor of Arts, Applied Arts, Education, and Social Work
</p><p>degrees. The faculty members are distinguished teachers, researchers and scholars, and the
</p><p>university holds two Canada Research Chairs.
</p><p></p><p>A PhD, or imminent completion is preferred; a Master’s degree is required. Each applicant is to
</p><p>submit a curriculum vitae, evidence of teaching effectiveness (teaching portfolio preferred), and
</p><p>arrange to have three letters of reference sent directly to Dr. Janice Harvey, Subject Coordinator
</p><p>for Environment and Society, St. Thomas University, Fredericton, NB E3B 5G3. Electronic
</p><p>applications may be sent to jeharvey@stu.ca.
</p><p></p><p>Closing date: <b>May 27, 2022, </b>or when the position is filled. Applicants are responsible for ensuring
</p><p>that their completed applications, including letters of reference, are received by this date.
</p><p></p><p>An equal opportunity employer, St. Thomas University is committed to employment equity for
</p><p>women, Aboriginal peoples, members of visible minority groups, and persons with disabilities.

Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Statement
<br/><br/>
The York Region District School Board (YRDSB) believes in giving each and every applicant an equal opportunity to succeed on their own merit and we strive to hire staff that reflect and support the diverse perspectives, experiences and needs of our students and our communities. We remain committed to upholding the values of equity, diversity, and inclusion in our living, learning and work environments. We know that diversity underpins excellence, and that we all share responsibility for creating an equitable, diverse and inclusive Board-community. Therefore, in pursuit of our values, we seek members who will work respectfully and constructively with differences and across the organizational hierarchy in actualizing the Board’s priorities, goals and principles outlined in the Director’s Action Plan.
<br/><br/>
We actively encourage applications from members of groups with historical and/or current barriers to equity, including, but not limited to:
<br/><br/>
First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples, and all other Indigenous peoples;
<br/><br/>
African, Black and Black Caribbean peoples (in alignment with Anti-Black Racism Strategy);
<br/><br/>
members of groups that commonly experience discrimination due to race, ancestry, colour, religion and/or spiritual beliefs, or place of origin;
<br/><br/>
persons with visible and/or invisible (physical and/or mental) disabilities;
<br/><br/>
persons who identify as women; and
<br/><br/>
persons of marginalized sexual orientations, gender identities, and gender expressions.
<br/><br/>
At YRDSB, we recognize that many of these identities intersect and therefore, equity, diversity and inclusion can be complex. We value and respect the contributions that each person brings to enriching the Board and are committed to ensuring full and equal participation for all in communities that we serve.
<br/><br/>

</p><p><b>ENVS 2113A </b>Ecological Literacy, THURSDAYS 2:30 PM – 5:20 PM
</p><p>This course introduces students to key ecological concepts through the study of the Grand Lake
</p><p>Lowlands ecoregion where Fredericton is located, including its biodiversity and ecosystems, the
</p><p>flow of materials, energy and waste from the ecosystem through human systems and back again,
</p><p>and the implications of these flows for sustainability. As they become acquainted with the local
</p><p>ecoregion, students will also explore the literary tradition of nature writing in which writers infuse
</p><p>their intense observations of local natural history with ethical reflections on being an inhabitant,
</p><p>rather than simply a resident, of a place.

</p><p>1,900. Its students graduate with Bachelor of Arts, Applied Arts, Education, and Social Work
</p><p>degrees. The faculty members are distinguished teachers, researchers and scholars, and the
</p><p>university holds two Canada Research Chairs.
</p><p></p><p>A PhD, or imminent completion is preferred; a Master’s degree is required. Each applicant is to
</p><p>submit a curriculum vitae, evidence of teaching effectiveness (teaching portfolio preferred), and
</p><p>arrange to have three letters of reference sent directly to Dr. Janice Harvey, Subject Coordinator
</p><p>for Environment and Society, St. Thomas University, Fredericton, NB E3B 5G3. Electronic
</p><p>applications may be sent to jeharvey@stu.ca.

<p>
Neh gaaw saga'igan is the local translation of Sandy Lake, where the people traditionally and continues to live off the abundance of land as hunters and gatherers. Though wild game is still a staple in the diets of many, today the people of Sandy Lake enjoy games and sports such as hockey, volleyball, softball, taekwondo, golf, and other modern sports.
</p><p>Located 450 km northeast of Winnipeg and 600 km northwest of Thunder Bay, we are a remote, fly-in First Nation community located in the boreal forested area of Northwestern Ontario along the Severn River. Beautiful landscapes surround our community, giving our people the opportunity for outdoor and social activities all-year-round. In the summer, we go hunting, hiking, kayaking, and fishing. In the winter, we go ice fishing, play ice hockey, and marvel at the beautiful northern lights above our open skies. Getting in and out of Sandy Lake is very convenient, with daily flights chartered by <b>Wasay</b><b>a Airways</b> and <b>Perimeter Aviations</b>, from multiple cities and towns in Winnipeg and Ontario.</p><p><br/>

Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Statement
<br/><br/>
The York Region District School Board (YRDSB) believes in giving each and every applicant an equal opportunity to succeed on their own merit and we strive to hire staff that reflect and support the diverse perspectives, experiences and needs of our students and our communities. We remain committed to upholding the values of equity, diversity, and inclusion in our living, learning and work environments. We know that diversity underpins excellence, and that we all share responsibility for creating an equitable, diverse and inclusive Board-community. Therefore, in pursuit of our values, we seek members who will work respectfully and constructively with differences and across the organizational hierarchy in actualizing the Board’s priorities, goals and principles outlined in the Director’s Action Plan.
<br/><br/>
We actively encourage applications from members of groups with historical and/or current barriers to equity, including, but not limited to:

First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples, and all other Indigenous peoples;

persons with visible and/or invisible (physical and/or mental) disabilities;
<br/><br/>
persons who identify as women; and
<br/><br/>
persons of marginalized sexual orientations, gender identities, and gender expressions.
<br/><br/>
At YRDSB, we recognize that many of these identities intersect and therefore, equity, diversity and inclusion can be complex. We value and respect the contributions that each person brings to enriching the Board and are committed to ensuring full and equal participation for all in communities that we serve.

</p><p>and the implications of these flows for sustainability. As they become acquainted with the local

</p><p>their intense observations of local natural history with ethical reflections on being an inhabitant,
</p><p>rather than simply a resident, of a place.

</p><p>university holds two Canada Research Chairs.
</p><p></p><p>A PhD, or imminent completion is preferred; a Master’s degree is required. Each applicant is to

<p>
Neh gaaw saga'igan is the local translation of Sandy Lake, where the people traditionally and continues to live off the abundance of land as hunters and gatherers. Though wild game is still a staple in the diets of many, today the people of Sandy Lake enjoy games and sports such as hockey, volleyball, softball, taekwondo, golf, and other modern sports.
</p><p>Located 450 km northeast of Winnipeg and 600 km northwest of Thunder Bay, we are a remote, fly-in First Nation community located in the boreal forested area of Northwestern Ontario along the Severn River.

In the winter, we go ice fishing, play ice hockey, and marvel at the beautiful northern lights above our open skies.

Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Statement
<br/><br/>
The York Region District School Board (YRDSB) believes in giving each and every applicant an equal opportunity to succeed on their own merit and we strive to hire staff that reflect and support the diverse perspectives, experiences and needs of our students and our communities. We remain committed to upholding the values of equity, diversity, and inclusion in our living, learning and work environments. We know that diversity underpins excellence, and that we all share responsibility for creating an equitable, diverse and inclusive Board-community. Therefore, in pursuit of our values, we seek members who will work respectfully and constructively with differences and across the organizational hierarchy in actualizing the Board’s priorities, goals and principles outlined in the Director’s Action Plan.
<br/><br/>
We actively encourage applications from members of groups with historical and/or current barriers to equity, including, but not limited to:

African, Black and Black Caribbean peoples (in alignment with Anti-Black Racism Strategy);

persons with visible and/or invisible (physical and/or mental) disabilities;
<br/><br/>
persons who identify as women; and
<br/><br/>
persons of marginalized sexual orientations, gender identities, and gender expressions.
<br/><br/>
At YRDSB, we recognize that many of these identities intersect and therefore, equity, diversity and inclusion can be complex. We value and respect the contributions that each person brings to enriching the Board and are committed to ensuring full and equal participation for all in communities that we serve.

</p><p><b>ENVS 2113A </b>Ecological Literacy, THURSDAYS 2:30 PM – 5:20 PM
</p><p>This course introduces students to key ecological concepts through the study of the Grand Lake
</p><p>Lowlands ecoregion where Fredericton is located, including its biodiversity and ecosystems, the
</p><p>flow of materials, energy and waste from the ecosystem through human systems and back again,
</p><p>and the implications of these flows for sustainability. As they become acquainted with the local
</p><p>ecoregion, students will also explore the literary tradition of nature writing in which writers infuse
</p><p>their intense observations of local natural history with ethical reflections on being an inhabitant,
</p><p>rather than simply a resident, of a place.
</p><p></p><p>St. Thomas University is an undergraduate, liberal arts institution with a full-time enrolment of
</p><p>1,900. Its students graduate with Bachelor of Arts, Applied Arts, Education, and Social Work
</p><p>degrees. The faculty members are distinguished teachers, researchers and scholars, and the
</p><p>university holds two Canada Research Chairs.
</p><p></p><p>A PhD, or imminent completion is preferred; a Master’s degree is required. Each applicant is to
</p><p>submit a curriculum vitae, evidence of teaching effectiveness (teaching portfolio preferred), and
</p><p>arrange to have three letters of reference sent directly to Dr. Janice Harvey, Subject Coordinator
</p><p>for Environment and Society, St. Thomas University, Fredericton, NB E3B 5G3. Electronic

Most of our band members live in Reserve #3 (Yekooche) located along the northwest arm of Stuart Lake, where Nan’cut Creek drains Cunningham Lake into Stuart Lake.</p><p>Do you love the outdoors? Our territory abounds with opportunities for hunting, fishing, ice fishing, trapping and living off the land. We share this land with bears, moose, rabbits, grouse, porcupines, beaver, salmon, and eagles, many varieties of berries, as well as herbs and medicines. Ample opportunities to explore the territory by snowmobile, ATV, snow shoes, kayak, and even sled from time to time.</p><p>The perks of being semi-isolated: pure water, clean air, peace and quiet, bright stars and Northern Lights, all four seasons, and the opportunity to live and learn on this land with the Dak’elh people who have thrived here since time immemorial</p><p>The people of Yekooche value their land, language, culture and history. You will be welcomed into the community where you will discover the peoples’ strong sense of tradition – as well as their sense of humour: teasing means we like you!

What does that statement mean to you?</li><li>Is it academics OR whole child? Or is it academics AND whole child?</li><li>How to use the BC Curriculum to overcome the historic damage and systemic barriers the Western educational model has imposed on our people?</li><li>How to move beyond remediation? How to accelerate?</li><li>Learning is reciprocal. You don’t need to know the Dak’elh language, or how to tan a moose hide – you just need to be willing and eager to learn – we will learn from each other.</li><li>Does this vision and do these questions resonate with you?

We emphasize language and culture throughout the school day, and are seeking educators who are eager to learn more about our traditions. We are also looking for teachers who hold high expectations for students, are sensitive to the historic damage and systemic racism inflicted on our people, and who believe in educating the whole child.

<p>
Neh gaaw saga'igan is the local translation of Sandy Lake, where the people traditionally and continues to live off the abundance of land as hunters and gatherers. Though wild game is still a staple in the diets of many, today the people of Sandy Lake enjoy games and sports such as hockey, volleyball, softball, taekwondo, golf, and other modern sports.
</p><p>Located 450 km northeast of Winnipeg and 600 km northwest of Thunder Bay, we are a remote, fly-in First Nation community located in the boreal forested area of Northwestern Ontario along the Severn River. Beautiful landscapes surround our community, giving our people the opportunity for outdoor and social activities all-year-round. In the summer, we go hunting, hiking, kayaking, and fishing. In the winter, we go ice fishing, play ice hockey, and marvel at the beautiful northern lights above our open skies. Getting in and out of Sandy Lake is very convenient, with daily flights chartered by <b>Wasay</b><b>a Airways</b> and <b>Perimeter Aviations</b>, from multiple cities and towns in Winnipeg and Ontario.</p><p><br/>

The York Region District School Board (YRDSB) believes in giving each and every applicant an equal opportunity to succeed on their own merit and we strive to hire staff that reflect and support the diverse perspectives, experiences and needs of our students and our communities. We remain committed to upholding the values of equity, diversity, and inclusion in our living, learning and work environments. We know that diversity underpins excellence, and that we all share responsibility for creating an equitable, diverse and inclusive Board-community. Therefore, in pursuit of our values, we seek members who will work respectfully and constructively with differences and across the organizational hierarchy in actualizing the Board’s priorities, goals and principles outlined in the Director’s Action Plan.

persons who identify as women; and
<br/><br/>
persons of marginalized sexual orientations, gender identities, and gender expressions.
