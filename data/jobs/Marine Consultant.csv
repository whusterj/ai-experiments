<p><b>Head of Marine Ecology </b><br/> Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada </p>
<p>Permanent, Full-time<br/> </p>
<p></p>
<p><br/> Sustainable Marine is a world-leading developer of sustainable energy solutions for islands <br/> and coastal communities. The company is currently building one of the world’s largest tidal-<br/> stream energy projects at the Fundy Ocean Research Centre for Energy (FORCE) in the <br/> Minas Passage in Nova Scotia. Sustainable Marine is working to increase the scientific <br/> knowledge and understanding of fish and marine mammal behavior in tidal flows and their <br/> potential interaction with man-made objects including floating tidal energy platforms.<br/> <br/> </p>
<p><b>The Opportunity </b><br/> <br/> Marine renewables have the potential to be a major source of clean energy that is almost <br/> completely untapped at present. To meet the UNFCCC Paris Agreement’s 2050 net zero <br/> targets and avoid catastrophic climate change, many consider that it is vital for countries to be <br/> able to harness the reliable and predictable resource of tidal energy in order to displace <br/> polluting forms of generation such as coal and diesel. Historically tidal energy projects have <br/> been barrage based, damming entire estuaries or rivers with associated impacts on the marine <br/> ecology. Sustainable Marine’s solution is different, utilizing innovative moored floating <br/> platforms with in-stream tidal turbines. <br/> <br/> Marine scientists, fishers, indigenous communities, government regulators and the public are <br/> all interested in understanding the potential interactions of marine mammals and fish with this <br/> new technology. The scientific consensus to date is that in-stream tidal turbines are unlikely <br/> to have much of an impact on marine ecology. However, work is still ongoing due to the <br/> following:<br/> </p>
<div>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>the sector is at a relatively early stage of development, </li>
<li>minimal use of monitoring equipment in fast flowing, energetic and potentially turbid </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
     waters of tidal energy sites, and 
     <br/>
<ul>
<li>differences between site locations, ecology and presence of individual species.<br/> </li>

</b><br/>
Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada
</p><p>Permanent, Full-time<br/>
</p><p></p><p><br/>
Sustainable Marine is a world-leading developer of sustainable energy solutions for islands
<br/>
and coastal communities. The company is currently building one of the world’s largest tidal-<br/>
stream energy projects at the Fundy Ocean Research Centre for Energy (FORCE) in the
<br/>
Minas Passage in Nova Scotia. Sustainable Marine is working to increase the scientific
<br/>
knowledge and understanding of fish and marine mammal behavior in tidal flows and their
<br/>
potential interaction with man-made objects including floating tidal energy platforms.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p><b>The Opportunity
</b><br/>
<br/>
Marine renewables have the potential to be a major source of clean energy that is almost
<br/>
completely untapped at present. To meet the UNFCCC Paris Agreement’s 2050 net zero
<br/>
targets and avoid catastrophic climate change, many consider that it is vital for countries to be
<br/>
able to harness the reliable and predictable resource of tidal energy in order to displace
<br/>
polluting forms of generation such as coal and diesel. Historically tidal energy projects have
<br/>
been barrage based, damming entire estuaries or rivers with associated impacts on the marine
<br/>
ecology. Sustainable Marine’s solution is different, utilizing innovative moored floating
<br/>
platforms with in-stream tidal turbines.
<br/>
<br/>
Marine scientists, fishers, indigenous communities, government regulators and the public are
<br/>
all interested in understanding the potential interactions of marine mammals and fish with this
<br/>
new technology. The scientific consensus to date is that in-stream tidal turbines are unlikely
<br/>
to have much of an impact on marine ecology. However, work is still ongoing due to the
<br/>
following:<br/>
</p><div><br/>
<ul><li>the sector is at a relatively early stage of development,
</li><li>minimal use of monitoring equipment in fast flowing, energetic and potentially turbid
</li></ul></div><div>waters of tidal energy sites, and
<br/>
<ul><li>differences between site locations, ecology and presence of individual species.<br/>
</li></ul></div><p><br/>
Sustainable Marine is investing in the development of world-class monitoring and data
<br/>
gathering systems that are designed to operate reliably in this environment, building upon its
<br/>
experience gathered to date. To achieve this, the company is supporting several industry-<br/>
leading initiatives with a number of collaborators and partners. We are also investigating the
<br/>
wider applicability of the solutions developed to supporting the development of a sustainable
<br/>
blue economy.
<br/>
<br/>
The Head of Marine Ecology will lead this stream of work, developing systems that use novel
<br/>
and innovative sensing technologies and data gathering techniques to inform the science of
<br/>
fish and marine mammal behavior in the unique and challenging environment of fast flowing
<br/>
tidal streams.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p></div></div><div><div><div><br/>
<br/>
<b>The successful candidate will be responsible for:</b>
<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>Coordinate with local research organizations and facilities such as Offshore Energy
</li></ul></div><p>Research Association (OERA), FORCE, Bedford Institute of Oceanography, academic
<br/>
institutions, external consultants, provincial and federal government regulators and
<br/>
partners, as well as international subject matter experts working in this field,
</p><ul><li>Ensure that scientific hypotheses are appropriately defined, peer-reviewed, tested and
</li></ul>reported,
<ul><li>Work with Sustainable Marine’s engineering team to develop and test monitoring systems,
</li></ul>ensuring it is performing as required and monitoring the development of new sensing
<br/>
technologies that could enhance our systems’ performance.
<ul><li>Manage data gathering, storage and analysis with third parties as appropriate.
</li><li>Develop advanced analysis techniques to process data. This will include working with
</li></ul><p>leading developers of automated techniques such as artificial intelligence and machine
<br/>
learning in order to filter, sort and interpret data to provide near-real time reporting and
<br/>
identify what requires deeper investigation.
</p><ul><li>Provide interpretation and analysis of results to ascertain how fish and marine mammals
</li></ul>behave and interact with our tidal energy systems.
<ul><li>Disseminate this information through research papers and presentations at academic and
</li></ul>industry conferences and communicate with a variety of technical and non-technical
<br/>
stakeholders, including regulators, other government agencies, First Nation communities
<br/>
and the public.<br/>
<p></p><br/>
<p><b>Qualifications and Experience
</b><br/>
<br/>
The successful candidate is likely to have a Masters or PhD in marine biology, ecology or
<br/>
similar with a focus on environmental research in the marine environment, with:<br/>
<br/>
</p><ul><li>Experience and strong interest in marine ecology and fish and marine mammal
</li></ul>behavior and interaction with man-made objects within dynamic situations.
<ul><li>Experience in the development, deployment and operation of environmental
</li></ul>monitoring systems such as echosounders, marine mammal click detectors, fish tag
<br/>
detectors, hydrophones and imaging sonars.
<ul><li>Proven ability to design, implement and deliver scientific programs with external
</li></ul>partners within budget and timelines to provide clear and unambiguous progress
<br/>
updates to key stakeholders.
<ul><li>Dynamic leader who takes the initiative and is a strong communicator.
</li></ul><br/>
Prior experience with tidal energy or other marine renewable energy technologies would be
<br/>
an asset but is not a prerequisite for this role.<br/>

</b><br/>
Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada
</p><p>Permanent, Full-time<br/>
</p><p></p><p><br/>
Sustainable Marine is a world-leading developer of sustainable energy solutions for islands
<br/>
and coastal communities. The company is currently building one of the world’s largest tidal-<br/>
stream energy projects at the Fundy Ocean Research Centre for Energy (FORCE) in the
<br/>
Minas Passage in Nova Scotia. Sustainable Marine is working to increase the scientific
<br/>
knowledge and understanding of fish and marine mammal behavior in tidal flows and their
<br/>
potential interaction with man-made objects including floating tidal energy platforms.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p><b>The Opportunity
</b><br/>
<br/>
Marine renewables have the potential to be a major source of clean energy that is almost
<br/>
completely untapped at present. To meet the UNFCCC Paris Agreement’s 2050 net zero
<br/>
targets and avoid catastrophic climate change, many consider that it is vital for countries to be
<br/>
able to harness the reliable and predictable resource of tidal energy in order to displace
<br/>
polluting forms of generation such as coal and diesel. Historically tidal energy projects have
<br/>
been barrage based, damming entire estuaries or rivers with associated impacts on the marine
<br/>
ecology. Sustainable Marine’s solution is different, utilizing innovative moored floating
<br/>
platforms with in-stream tidal turbines.
<br/>
<br/>
Marine scientists, fishers, indigenous communities, government regulators and the public are
<br/>
all interested in understanding the potential interactions of marine mammals and fish with this
<br/>
new technology. The scientific consensus to date is that in-stream tidal turbines are unlikely
<br/>
to have much of an impact on marine ecology. However, work is still ongoing due to the
<br/>
following:<br/>
</p><div><br/>
<ul><li>the sector is at a relatively early stage of development,
</li><li>minimal use of monitoring equipment in fast flowing, energetic and potentially turbid
</li></ul></div><div>waters of tidal energy sites, and
<br/>
<ul><li>differences between site locations, ecology and presence of individual species.<br/>
</li></ul></div><p><br/>
Sustainable Marine is investing in the development of world-class monitoring and data
<br/>
gathering systems that are designed to operate reliably in this environment, building upon its
<br/>
experience gathered to date. To achieve this, the company is supporting several industry-<br/>
leading initiatives with a number of collaborators and partners. We are also investigating the
<br/>
wider applicability of the solutions developed to supporting the development of a sustainable
<br/>
blue economy.
<br/>
<br/>
The Head of Marine Ecology will lead this stream of work, developing systems that use novel
<br/>
and innovative sensing technologies and data gathering techniques to inform the science of
<br/>
fish and marine mammal behavior in the unique and challenging environment of fast flowing
<br/>
tidal streams.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p></div></div><div><div><div><br/>
<br/>
<b>The successful candidate will be responsible for:</b>
<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>Coordinate with local research organizations and facilities such as Offshore Energy
</li></ul></div><p>Research Association (OERA), FORCE, Bedford Institute of Oceanography, academic
<br/>
institutions, external consultants, provincial and federal government regulators and
<br/>
partners, as well as international subject matter experts working in this field,
</p><ul><li>Ensure that scientific hypotheses are appropriately defined, peer-reviewed, tested and
</li></ul>reported,
<ul><li>Work with Sustainable Marine’s engineering team to develop and test monitoring systems,
</li></ul>ensuring it is performing as required and monitoring the development of new sensing
<br/>
technologies that could enhance our systems’ performance.
<ul><li>Manage data gathering, storage and analysis with third parties as appropriate.
</li><li>Develop advanced analysis techniques to process data. This will include working with
</li></ul><p>leading developers of automated techniques such as artificial intelligence and machine
<br/>
learning in order to filter, sort and interpret data to provide near-real time reporting and
<br/>
identify what requires deeper investigation.
</p><ul><li>Provide interpretation and analysis of results to ascertain how fish and marine mammals
</li></ul>behave and interact with our tidal energy systems.
<ul><li>Disseminate this information through research papers and presentations at academic and
</li></ul>industry conferences and communicate with a variety of technical and non-technical
<br/>
stakeholders, including regulators, other government agencies, First Nation communities
<br/>
and the public.<br/>
<p></p><br/>
<p><b>Qualifications and Experience
</b><br/>
<br/>
The successful candidate is likely to have a Masters or PhD in marine biology, ecology or
<br/>
similar with a focus on environmental research in the marine environment, with:<br/>
<br/>
</p><ul><li>Experience and strong interest in marine ecology and fish and marine mammal
</li></ul>behavior and interaction with man-made objects within dynamic situations.
<ul><li>Experience in the development, deployment and operation of environmental
</li></ul>monitoring systems such as echosounders, marine mammal click detectors, fish tag
<br/>
detectors, hydrophones and imaging sonars.
<ul><li>Proven ability to design, implement and deliver scientific programs with external
</li></ul>partners within budget and timelines to provide clear and unambiguous progress
<br/>
updates to key stakeholders.
<ul><li>Dynamic leader who takes the initiative and is a strong communicator.
</li></ul><br/>
Prior experience with tidal energy or other marine renewable energy technologies would be
<br/>
an asset but is not a prerequisite for this role.<br/>

Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada
</p><p>Permanent, Full-time<br/>
</p><p></p><p><br/>
Sustainable Marine is a world-leading developer of sustainable energy solutions for islands
<br/>
and coastal communities. The company is currently building one of the world’s largest tidal-<br/>
stream energy projects at the Fundy Ocean Research Centre for Energy (FORCE) in the
<br/>
Minas Passage in Nova Scotia. Sustainable Marine is working to increase the scientific
<br/>
knowledge and understanding of fish and marine mammal behavior in tidal flows and their
<br/>
potential interaction with man-made objects including floating tidal energy platforms.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p><b>The Opportunity
</b><br/>
<br/>
Marine renewables have the potential to be a major source of clean energy that is almost
<br/>
completely untapped at present. To meet the UNFCCC Paris Agreement’s 2050 net zero
<br/>
targets and avoid catastrophic climate change, many consider that it is vital for countries to be
<br/>
able to harness the reliable and predictable resource of tidal energy in order to displace
<br/>
polluting forms of generation such as coal and diesel. Historically tidal energy projects have
<br/>
been barrage based, damming entire estuaries or rivers with associated impacts on the marine
<br/>
ecology. Sustainable Marine’s solution is different, utilizing innovative moored floating
<br/>
platforms with in-stream tidal turbines.
<br/>
<br/>
Marine scientists, fishers, indigenous communities, government regulators and the public are
<br/>
all interested in understanding the potential interactions of marine mammals and fish with this
<br/>
new technology. The scientific consensus to date is that in-stream tidal turbines are unlikely
<br/>
to have much of an impact on marine ecology. However, work is still ongoing due to the
<br/>
following:<br/>
</p><div><br/>
<ul><li>the sector is at a relatively early stage of development,
</li><li>minimal use of monitoring equipment in fast flowing, energetic and potentially turbid

Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada
</p><p>Permanent, Full-time<br/>
</p><p></p><p><br/>
Sustainable Marine is a world-leading developer of sustainable energy solutions for islands
<br/>
and coastal communities. The company is currently building one of the world’s largest tidal-<br/>
stream energy projects at the Fundy Ocean Research Centre for Energy (FORCE) in the
<br/>
Minas Passage in Nova Scotia. Sustainable Marine is working to increase the scientific
<br/>
knowledge and understanding of fish and marine mammal behavior in tidal flows and their
<br/>
potential interaction with man-made objects including floating tidal energy platforms.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p><b>The Opportunity
</b><br/>
<br/>
Marine renewables have the potential to be a major source of clean energy that is almost
<br/>
completely untapped at present. To meet the UNFCCC Paris Agreement’s 2050 net zero
<br/>
targets and avoid catastrophic climate change, many consider that it is vital for countries to be
<br/>
able to harness the reliable and predictable resource of tidal energy in order to displace
<br/>
polluting forms of generation such as coal and diesel. Historically tidal energy projects have
<br/>
been barrage based, damming entire estuaries or rivers with associated impacts on the marine
<br/>
ecology. Sustainable Marine’s solution is different, utilizing innovative moored floating
<br/>
platforms with in-stream tidal turbines.
<br/>
<br/>
Marine scientists, fishers, indigenous communities, government regulators and the public are
<br/>
all interested in understanding the potential interactions of marine mammals and fish with this
<br/>
new technology. The scientific consensus to date is that in-stream tidal turbines are unlikely
<br/>
to have much of an impact on marine ecology. However, work is still ongoing due to the
<br/>
following:<br/>
</p><div><br/>
<ul><li>the sector is at a relatively early stage of development,
</li><li>minimal use of monitoring equipment in fast flowing, energetic and potentially turbid
