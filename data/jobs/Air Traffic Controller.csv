    A career in Air Traffic Services with NAV CANADA is anything but ordinary. We manage 18 million square kilometers of Canadian and oceanic airspace, and with 40,000 customers and 3.3 million flights a year, we are one of the largest Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) in the world!
   <br/>
<br/> A career with NAV CANADA is both challenging and rewarding, and no two days on the job are the same. The services provided by our Air Traffic Controllers and Flight Service Specialists help pilots keep aircraft safely separated from other aircraft and obstacles, while in flight or on the ground.
  </div>
<div></div>
<div>
    Our Air Traffic Controllers are responsible for coordinating the safe, efficient and orderly flow of air traffic in seven flight information regions, working in Control Towers and Area Control Centres (ACCs) across the country.

    </div></li>

    </div></li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<div>
    Our Flight Service Specialists provide timely, essential information to arriving and departing aircraft at their respective locations such as: traffic advisories, control vehicles on the ground, weather information, flight guidance and airport advisory services.
