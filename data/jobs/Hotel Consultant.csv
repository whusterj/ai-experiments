While we are proud of our heritage, we are even more excited about our future, and if you are the person we are looking for, we'd be excited to share it with you.

You anticipate the needs of your customers, look ahead and prevent problems from arising. This position involves scheduling (and rescheduling) meetings, booking (and unbooking) travel, managing case team logistics, keeping track of time and expenses, and keeping up with the fast pace of our Consulting Team.
<br/>
<br/>
We operate in a hybrid model, meaning you’ll be in the office about half of the time and have flexibility to work remotely (if you choose) for the other part of the week. While in the office, you will be surrounded by a community of intelligent, highly motivated and service-minded people. Sr. AAs help shape our culture by actively participating in office life, and collaborate across functions to help fellow Business Services Team (BST) members.

We work hard together, and we go out of our way to support each other – we want everyone to be successful, individually and as a team.<br/>
<br/>
We won't define a career path for you – but some of our Sr. AAs we've hired in this role have gone on to have long and successful careers as Executive Assistants at BCG; others have gone into work in one of our many Practice Areas; some have managed teams or rotated through a number of other functions.

<b>What we’re looking for:</b><br/>
Our busy import dealership is accepting applications for the position of a professional Sales and Lease Consultant. Previous automotive sales experience is not necessary, as we offer full training and a little different culture than the average car dealership.

<br/><br/>
<b>What we offer:</b><br/>
Complete onsite training will be provided

<b>What we’re looking for:</b><br/>
Our busy import dealership is accepting applications for the position of a professional Sales and Lease Consultant. Previous automotive sales experience is not necessary, as we offer full training and a little different culture than the average car dealership.
<br/><br/>
You will be responsible for meeting and greeting clients, guiding test drives, and assisting our clients in their purchases while building your business and career.
<br/><br/>
<b>Who we’re looking for:</b><br/>
Phenomenal customer service before anything else. Ambitious. Driven. Thrives in a competitive environment. These are words and terms that describe the kind of person we’re looking for. We’re not looking for average, we’re looking for excellence.

<b>Who should apply:</b><br/>
You’d be surprised who can really make it in our industry.

Basically, if customer service is a big drive for you and you live every day with a positive attitude, you might like what we have to offer. A valid driver’s license is the only must for now.
<br/><br/>
<b>What we offer:</b><br/>
Complete onsite training will be provided
<br/><br/>
Competitive compensation packages. The average sales consultant can earn $40 000 per year. A good sales consultant can earn $60-70 000 per year. Top performers will earn $100 000+. We’re not looking for average.

A positive, customer-focused culture of service and reputation.
<br/><br/>

<b>What we’re looking for:</b><br/>
Our busy import dealership is accepting applications for the position of a professional Sales and Lease Consultant. Previous automotive sales experience is not necessary, as we offer full training and a little different culture than the average car dealership.
<br/><br/>
You will be responsible for meeting and greeting clients, guiding test drives, and assisting our clients in their purchases while building your business and career.
<br/><br/>
<b>Who we’re looking for:</b><br/>
Phenomenal customer service before anything else. Ambitious. Driven. Thrives in a competitive environment. These are words and terms that describe the kind of person we’re looking for. We’re not looking for average, we’re looking for excellence.
<br/><br/>
You’ll be joining an established and successful team of professional Sales Consultants, and we’re looking to build your career with us to heights you might not think are possible.
<br/><br/>
<b>Who should apply:</b><br/>
You’d be surprised who can really make it in our industry. We have success stories with recent university and college grads of all kinds, hotel staff, restaurant employees (particularly waiters and waitresses), even home improvement and big box store employees. Basically, if customer service is a big drive for you and you live every day with a positive attitude, you might like what we have to offer. A valid driver’s license is the only must for now.
<br/><br/>
<b>What we offer:</b><br/>
Complete onsite training will be provided
<br/><br/>
Competitive compensation packages. The average sales consultant can earn $40 000 per year. A good sales consultant can earn $60-70 000 per year. Top performers will earn $100 000+. We’re not looking for average.
<br/><br/>
A positive, customer-focused culture of service and reputation.
<br/><br/>
Honesty and integrity are our watchwords. You’ll never need to compromise your excellent ethical and moral standards.
<br/><br/>
