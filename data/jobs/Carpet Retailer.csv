<p>We’re looking for an enthusiastic, organized, and proactive individual to take responsibility for the nitty gritty of our ecommerce program. You’ll manage all facets of key ecommerce accounts, working with the sales and marketing teams to execute our growth strategy and turn vision into reality.</p>
<p>It’s a challenging, demanding role that’s not for everyone, but might just be right for you.</p>
<p><b>Who Are You? </b></p>
<ul>
<li>You’re an organizational rock star: You can manage and keep track of numerous tasks associated with overlapping projects and multiple accounts.</li>
