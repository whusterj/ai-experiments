Or perhaps trying to decide where to start up your career? We invite you to take 2 minutes to read this post as some food for thought. <br/><br/><br/>Yes, Hand and Stone Burlington is a big location, we have 7 treatment rooms offering Registered Massage Therapy, and that takes a certain amount of staff. For some, this is not a fit, and we understand, but please allow us to share a different perspective.<br/>Hand and Stone Burlington is easily one of, if not the number one, go to place for Registered Massage Therapy in Burlington and surrounding areas. We've been in the community for nearly 10 years and have a great reputation (Google us to be sure). Clients know they have access to a variety of providers with various techniques and strengths, so having different staff to find their match with is a huge asset and brings them in to us. Additionally, clients know they can call and get in to see an RMT within 24 hours when needed, be it for an acute or nagging concern, to relieve accumulating stress, or spoil themselves, so that means you will see variety in your day. <br/>Yes, we're a busy location, BUT, we're a busy location. You can let go of that stress of having to market yourself, or worry whether you will make the income you require, or be bored day after day, week after week without being able to do what you trained hard to become. That would be kind of nice, wouldn't it? <br/>So, why not give us a call and find out a bit more. Not every location is run by the same owner, and this one is not like the others.  There's a reason we're the number ONE Spa, year after year.<br/> <br/>We have all kinds of other stuff to tell you about how you can make up to $1400 per week, before gratuities, working 25 appointments, or how our computer system lets you check your schedule or make notes from your phone, or how if you're a new grad you can get your CMTO and licensing fees paid for up front, or how we'll pay you to learn Himalayan salt stone and hot stone treatments, decompression therapy/cupping, prenatal massage and lots more, as well as tons of other great stuff, but you'll need to reach out first. A phone conversation with us just might be the change you're looking for.  <br/>If you're not an RMT yet, and are nervous about completing your licensing tests (MCQ and OSCE), we can help you with that too.  We are partnered with a great company that offers a prep course to help you succeed, and we pay for this course for you - a $475 value.  Just reach out to us to learn how.  We want to support you and see you succeed.<br/><br/>What it's like to work at Hand &amp; Stone Burlington:<br/>-Start your day with a friendly smile from out front desk team and a quick covid screen (done for all staff everyday to ensure your safety), <br/>-review your clients on our computers, tablets, or your phone, <br/>-take your client from our lobby to your treatment room, <br/>-perform your unique massage treatment, <br/>-sign the insurance receipt that has been prepared for you in a folder at the front desk, <br/>-remake the table (with help from our cleaning team when possible) using linens stocked in the room for you, <br/>-leave the used linens in laundry bins where they are laundered, folded and restocked in the treatment room for you, <br/>-make a treatment note (again from your phone, tablet, or computer), and <br/>-collect your next client (or head home, if it's the end of your day).  <br/><br/>That's it.  Your clients are booked, welcomed, prescreened, rebooked, and invoiced for you by our front desk team that care deeply about customer service, without any additional charges or deductions from your pay.<br/>If you're a new grad, there's also a 7 step program to support your growth and practice as a new RMT for 1 full YEAR by one of our in-house coach/mentor/trainers.  They answer any questions you have as you navigate challenges and new situations that come with starting out as an RMT.  This is the program that also pays for up to $1000.00 of your registration fees. <br/><br/>Here's a bunch of other stuff that we're supposed to say and that is important...<br/><strong><br/></strong>Just so you know, we are on top of everything; we follow strict COVID-19 safety, cleaning and disinfecting protocols for our Spa, so everyone will feel safe in our environment. PPE and all cleaning and disinfecting materials are provided for you and clients must sign a pre-screen clearance and waiver prior to treatment.  It is a priority to support our team so that their days can<strong></strong>run smoothly. <br/><br/>We believe in creating an inclusive and uplifting environment for everyone at Hand &amp; Stone with trust and respect as our guide.We look forward to speaking with you and sharing how we work diligently to create a safe and healthy environment for everyone.  <br/><strong>QUALIFICATIONS:</strong>• Current Massage Therapy registration with the CMTO<br/>• Reliable, confident and effective communication• Passionate, nurturing and caring disposition<br/><br/><br/>#HSBurlington<p><em>I acknowledge that I am applying for employment with an independently owned and operated Hand &amp; Stone franchisee, a separate company and employer from H&amp;S Massage Spa Canada Corporation and any of its affiliates or subsidiaries.

Vitality Physiotherapy and Wellness Centre has patient needs, quality service, and overall client experience as its core values. This is the change the industry needed.When looking for a new clinic, patients may face a daunting experience, filled with unknowns. Not knowing what to expect or what the path to recovery might look like can take a toll on patients. This can sometimes limit patients from finding the right health care professional and delay their recovery. In order to help patients in their path to recovery, our founder understood this and wanted to transform the industry.Here’s the story of how Vitality Physiotherapy and Wellness Centre came to be the revolutionary industry leader it is today: In 2016, Vitality Physiotherapy and Wellness Centre founder and registered physiotherapist Andrew Istefanos learned that the physiotherapy industry operated using outdated procedures. From his experience working in various clinics in the Greater Toronto Area, he learned that these outdated procedures were the industry norm. Andrew quickly realized that his patient-centered approach helped his patients achieve true wellness.. He believed collaborative care including physiotherapy and massage therapy was meant to be personal, one-on-one, and integrated. Developing a system with individualized treatments influenced by advanced clinical research including manual therapy and movement based exercises, Andrew quickly started to define the future of rehab. This approach created an environment that encouraged dialogue with patients and noted their needs and wants. As a result of this dialogue, it became clear that patients wanted an elevated experience, available in luxurious spaces with private rooms and an open-concept gym with state of the art equipment. With these founding principles, Vitality Physiotherapy and Wellness Centre came to life.</p></section>","['Build relationships with other staff and thrive within the culture', 'Diversify your clinical work and get involved in the business side of things', 'Fee-split ($)', 'Develop and communicate clearly personalized treatment plans for each client based on their ultimate goals and their “why”', 'Build strong rapport with clients from a variety of backgrounds through strong communication and providing the Vitality experience', ""Follow the clinics' processes and operations to provide the Vitality experience"", 'Personal branding for referrals', 'Effectively understand the client’s medical history, symptoms, and long-term goals to focus on longevity', 'Appropriate liability insurance', 'Participate in on-going clinical education (internal and external)', 'Empowering together', 'Remote access to documentation', 'Wants to explore and grow with the team with clear career planning', 'Company sponsored team dinners and Quarterly appreciation events ($)', 'Accurately document as per college guideline client’s condition and progress', '5 Assessments per week to build your caseload ($)\xa0 Full Case Load Available', 'Extra hours available ($)', 'Regular Support in building and maintaining your caseload ($)', 'Practice new and advance techniques to build and sharpen your skills', 'Understand the Vitality philosophy and deliver an exceptional client experience', 'Focus on your clinical work and be a super-star therapist for your patients', 'Licensed and in good standing with CMTO', 'Strong communication skills and engagement', 'Understand how to quickly implement new technology and software changes in the ever-changing industry to enhance client engagement', 'Paid subscription (approx. $200) to clinician education site Embodia ($)', 'Other perks (see below)', 'Celebrating the wellbeing and success of every person', 'Signing Bonus ($)', 'Remote access for online charting', 'You will meet monthly with a Lead RMT', 'Get help to build a full caseload and maintain it', 'Paid time off for self-care, family/friends, travel ($)', 'Participate in community development initiatives to drive branding awareness and new assessments.', 'Paid onboarding and training ($)']"

Vitality Physiotherapy and Wellness Centre has patient needs, quality service, and overall client experience as its core values. This is the change the industry needed.When looking for a new clinic, patients may face a daunting experience, filled with unknowns. Not knowing what to expect or what the path to recovery might look like can take a toll on patients. This can sometimes limit patients from finding the right health care professional and delay their recovery. In order to help patients in their path to recovery, our founder understood this and wanted to transform the industry.Here’s the story of how Vitality Physiotherapy and Wellness Centre came to be the revolutionary industry leader it is today: In 2016, Vitality Physiotherapy and Wellness Centre founder and registered physiotherapist Andrew Istefanos learned that the physiotherapy industry operated using outdated procedures. From his experience working in various clinics in the Greater Toronto Area, he learned that these outdated procedures were the industry norm. Andrew quickly realized that his patient-centered approach helped his patients achieve true wellness.. He believed collaborative care including physiotherapy and massage therapy was meant to be personal, one-on-one, and integrated. Developing a system with individualized treatments influenced by advanced clinical research including manual therapy and movement based exercises, Andrew quickly started to define the future of rehab. This approach created an environment that encouraged dialogue with patients and noted their needs and wants. As a result of this dialogue, it became clear that patients wanted an elevated experience, available in luxurious spaces with private rooms and an open-concept gym with state of the art equipment. With these founding principles, Vitality Physiotherapy and Wellness Centre came to life.</p></section>","['Diversify your clinical work and get involved in the business side of things', 'Fee-split ($)', 'Wants to explore and grow with the team with clear career planning.', 'Practice new and advance techniques to build and sharpen your skills.', 'Personal branding for referrals.', 'Company-sponsored team dinners and Quarterly appreciation events ($)', 'Empowering together', 'Remote access to documentation.', 'Extra hours available ($)', 'Regular Support in building and maintaining your caseload ($)', '5 Assessments per week to build your caseload ($) Full Case Load Available**', 'Focus on your clinical work and be a super-star therapist for your patients', 'Appropriate liability insurance.', 'Build relationships with other staff and thrive within the culture.', 'Remote access for online charting.', 'Paid subscription (approx. $200) to clinician education site Embodia ($)', ""Follow the clinics' processes and operations to provide the Vitality experience."", 'Develop and communicate clearly personalized treatment plans for each client based on their ultimate goals and their “why”.', 'Strong communication skills and engagement.', 'Other perks (see below)', 'Understand how to quickly implement new technology and software changes in the ever-changing industry to enhance client engagement.', 'You will meet monthly with a Lead RMT.', 'Celebrating the wellbeing and success of every person', 'Participate in ongoing clinical education (internal and external).', 'Effectively understand the client’s medical history, symptoms, and long-term goals to focus on longevity.', 'Signing Bonus ($)', 'Get help to build a full caseload and maintain it.', 'Build strong rapport with clients from a variety of backgrounds through strong communication and providing the Vitality experience.', 'Paid time off for self-care, family/friends, travel ($)', 'Licensed and in good standing with CMTO.', 'Accurately document as per college guideline client’s condition and progress.', 'Participate in community development initiatives to drive branding awareness and new assessments.', 'Paid onboarding and training ($)', 'Understand the Vitality philosophy and deliver an exceptional client experience.']"
