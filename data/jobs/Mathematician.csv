This is a tenured appointment at the rank of Associate or Full Professor, commensurate with the candidate's qualifications and experience.</p>
<p>This position has an anticipated start date of July 1, 2023, pending a successful CRC nomination, or such other date as may be negotiated with the successful applicant. Review of applications will commence by May 15, 2022 and will continue until the position is filled.</p>
<p>Per UNB regulations, the applicant must have a PhD in a discipline relevant to ecological modelling or data science. These disciplines may include, but are not limited to Biology, Statistics, and Mathematics. We seek applicants with a demonstrated record of research excellence indicated through a high-quality publishing record in highly-regarded scholarly journals and international conferences who apply their interdisciplinary knowledge to problems in biological systems. The Chair will establish an externally-funded research program at UNB that includes use of cutting-edge quantitative approaches to address research questions related to coastal ecosystems. This may include but is not limited to research addressing problems relevant to ecosystem management (e.g., contaminants, climate change, conservation, fisheries &amp; aquaculture, ecological forecasting, risk assessment, decision science, population, community &amp; nutrient dynamics). The Chair will attract, develop, and retain excellent students (Honours, MSc, and PhD) and other trainees. The Chair is expected to contribute to undergraduate teaching (no more than the equivalent of one course per year) and to departmental and university service at a reduced rate from that of regular faculty members. Candidates should have demonstrated excellence in teaching, including at the undergraduate level, and a commitment to an inclusive learning environment for all students.</p>
<p>Tier 1 chairs are for outstanding researchers acknowledged by their peers as world leaders in their fields. UNB recognizes the legitimate impact that leaves (e.g., parental, illness) can have on a candidate's record of research achievement. Leaves will be taken into careful consideration during the assessment process. Please consult the Canada Research Chairs website for full program information, including further details on eligibility criteria. This position will uphold UNB's commitment to increasing the representation of under-represented groups among its chairholders. Therefore, only applicants who self-identify within the four designated groups (as designated within Canada's employment equity act) will be considered for this opportunity. Applicants must identify within one or more of the following groups: women, racialized people, people with disabilities, and Indigenous people. Please note that the category of ""women"" includes individuals who identify as cisgender women, transgender women, transgender men, two-spirit, and non-binary.</p>
<p>UNB has been nurturing discovery and innovation for over 200 years. The Saint John campus, located where one of the largest watersheds in North America flows into the Bay of Fundy, has recognized strengths in Coastal Studies and is actively fostering further growth in this area. The Departments of Biological Sciences and Mathematics and Statistics offer 4-year BSc degrees in Marine Biology, Biology, Environmental Biology, Biology-Psychology, Mathematics, and Statistics as well as research-based MSc and PhD degrees in various areas of Biology, Mathematics, and Statistics. The Department of Biological Sciences has 20 faculty members with research expertise in a variety of fields of biology (with a focus on coastal ecosystems), as well as geology, chemistry, and physics. The Department of Mathematics and Statistics has a complement of 5 mathematicians and 2 statisticians with research expertise in applied mathematics, and statistical methodology for biological applications. For more information, visit the Faculty website: http://www.unb.ca/saintjohn/sase. The concentration of expertise in marine biology and coastal studies within UNB Saint John and the region, including the Department of Fisheries and Oceans' Saint Andrews Biological Station, the Huntsman Marine Science Centre, and the New Brunswick Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture, provides many opportunities for collaboration. Historic Saint John is a vibrant small coastal city known for its livability and accessibility to a diversity of pristine natural ecosystems and outdoor recreation activities (https://saintjohn.ca/)</p>

More about Hopper

Despite the pandemic’s impact on the travel industry, Hopper has emerged stronger than ever. As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has demonstrated significant outperformance with its category-leading mobile-only marketplace, delivering value to customers and supply partners with the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

- Hopper’s valuation is now over $5B, which is more than triple our valuation from early 2020.

- The company grew its revenue by more than 300% YoY in 2021. Hopper’s monthly revenues are now 375% higher than its pre-pandemic high point and Hopper Cloud, Hopper’s new B2B initiative, is already 15% of its revenues and growing.

- According to Apptopia, Hopper was the #1 most downloaded OTA in the US in 2021. The app has over 70 million downloads.

- Hopper’s recovery is faster than the market and its share of the air travel market in North America is now 300% higher than prior to the pandemic, according to MIDT. We are now the 3rd largest air travel agency in North America.

- The company sells over $2B in travel and travel related financial services annually.

- Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent over 70% of its air revenue.

- Given the success of its travel fintech, Hopper recently launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud, where any travel provider can unlock a totally unique revenue stream by seamlessly integrating and offering Hopper’s travel content and fintech products. Hopper Cloud partners include Capital One, Kayak, Marriott, Amadeus,Trip.com, and MakeMyTrip.

The industry opportunity for Hopper Cloud is enormous as projections estimate that if all travel distribution channels offered travel fintech, it could increase the total consumer spend for the sector by $200 billion annually.

And all this recent growth is just the beginning. There are still so many new opportunities we’re excited to tackle in the next year!</section>",[]

PARIS is a transformative initiative for the Private Career College (PCC) sector as it represents a major leap forward from largely paper-based processes to true digitally enabled service delivery. Re-engineered business processes and automation has greatly reduced the administrative burden on both the PCC sector and the Private Career Colleges Branch (PCCB’s) internal operations and led to improved turn-around times for key services. Ever since its implementation in 2018, PARIS is providing a client-focused user experience for its sector stakeholders through a modern user interface and the convenience of paperless application submission and online payment processing. In order to maintain the support, PARIS functionalities are continuously enhanced to implement new requirements &amp; functional enhancements of gaps identified post GO-Live impacting services to the sector. <br/><br/><a href=""/"" rel=""nofollow nofollow"">Randstad Canada</a> is committed to fostering a workforce reflective of all peoples of Canada.
