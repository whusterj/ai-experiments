<p>About Earls Kitchen + Bar</p>
<p><i> Some 40 years ago, Leroy “Bus” Earl Fuller and his son Stanley Earl Fuller had a simple idea: to create a laid-back burger and beer joint filled with warm, friendly people. The first Earls restaurant opened in Edmonton, Alberta in 1984, and it quickly took off — Earls has never looked back, opening locations across Canada and the US. Today, Earls has expanded to 69 locations (and counting!) and we're looking forward to our continued growth across North America.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i><br/> While much has changed since Bus and Stan opened the first Earls restaurant all those years ago, many things are the same — Earls is still a family-owned business, run by great people who are passionate about serving our guests delicious, globally-inspired food and drinks through exceptional service and an inviting environment. Our people are at the heart of everything we do, and we’re driven to make their lives awesome through the Earls Experience.

<p><b>Earls Kitchen + Bar</b></p>
<p> Some 35 years ago, Leroy “Bus” Earl Fuller and his son Stanley Earl Fuller had a simple idea: create a laid-back burger and beer joint. When the restaurant started there was no question what it would be called, it had to be Earls. The Edmonton Alberta restaurant quickly took off because, well, who says no to burgers and beer? Since then, much has changed. Yet Earls is still a family-owned business filled with people who are genuinely passionate about great food and drinks served in an inviting environment.<br/> <br/> Today, Earls is based in Vancouver, British Columbia and has 69 locations across North America ranging from our west-coast hometown to Miami, Florida. With 6,500 employees, Earls remains committed to offering guests high-quality globally inspired food with great service in an authentic atmosphere.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/> The Host</b></p>
<p> As the very first touch point when guests arrive at the restaurant, the Hosts set the tone for the entire Earls experience. The Host team is the “quarterback” of the service team, responsible for creating the flow of guests into the restaurant to ensure our kitchen and servers can deliver world class service. They’re the linchpin to the restaurant running smoothly and the entire team being able to deliver on the company’s mission...which is nothing to shake a menu at.</p>

</ul>
<p></p>
<p><br/> Our ultimate goal is that you leave here with tools in your pocket to live a life you’re on fire for; whether you stay with the company for 5 weeks or 5 (or more!) years.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/> As a Host, you’ll: </b></p>
