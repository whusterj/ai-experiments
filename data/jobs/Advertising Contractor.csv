<p><b>COVID-19 Considerations </b></p>
<p>We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard. </p>

<li>Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed; </li>

<li>You take pride in keeping the décor area organized, especially when it comes to organizing the colour displays, wallpaper books, décor literature and all of the other little details that help make the décor area an inspirational place for customers to visit.</li>
<li>You get excited to help educate customers on the best products they need for their job. You look at every customer and customer service experience as an opportunity to teach, grow and learn.</li>
<li>No matter what time your shift starts you always show up early and you look forward to sticking around a bit extra if a teammate needs a helping hand.</li>
<li>You enjoy working in groups on various projects that help enhance the overall customer service experience (e.g. creating new ideas to advertise promos, redecorating the store to provide inspirational ideas to customers, working with the advertising team to come up with a new radio commercial, etc.).</li>
<li>You know how and when to ask for help from your team.</li>
<li>You see the value in cultural development and are always open to change.</li>
