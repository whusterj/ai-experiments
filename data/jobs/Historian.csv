<p>Part-Time Opportunity Announcement</p>
<p><b><i>Background</i></b></p>
<p>Muskoday First Nation is beginning its journey of both discovery and healing from the impact of residential schools attended both by living community members as well as those who have passed on to the spirit world. Colonial history unfolded in a way that saw Muskoday lose much of its own history. Gaps in family genealogy, lost language, forgotten storytelling, and uncertainty around our own cultural values and traditions are but a few of the hardships Muskoday First Nation community members have endured. A major concern for our community is not knowing how many of our living or deceased community members attended residential school. Worse, is not knowing how many children from our community never came home.</p>
<p>To find these answers, Muskoday is embarking upon a new project titled: <i>Finding and Honouring Our Muskoday Children Lost at Residential Schools. </i>The project involves engagement of community to assess missing knowledge pieces, collection of residential school student records, proper capture of oral history, identifying the location of missing residential school children, developing a commemorative healing and reflection space for our residential school children, and supporting community members impacted by this project.</p>
<p><b><i>About the Opportunity</i></b></p>
<p>· The <i>Residential School Historian</i> is a part-time contract position designed to collect information that develops our understanding of the involvement of Muskoday children in residential schools throughout Saskatchewan and other provinces.</p>
<p>· The position holder will be required to engage community members in dialogue on their ancestors, children who attended residential school, and identify gaps in history caused by the experience.</p>
<p>· The position holder will collaborate with other First Nation communities who are also in the process of accessing student records, and work with these partners to determine the number and location of Muskoday children who attended residential school.</p>
<p>· Where missing Muskoday children are identified, the position holder will work to link families with the burial site and support them in determining an appropriate solution.</p>
<p>· Guided by community consultation, the position holder shall coordinate the planning and development of a memorial structure or space that commemorates Muskoday children who attended residential school.</p>
<p>· The position is a part-time contract, with the potential for renewal upon satisfactory service delivery.</p>
<p>· The opportunity is open to all individuals, regardless of ethnicity, race, gender or religion.</p>
<p><b><i>Required Qualifications</i></b></p>
<p>· Effective at engaging community members, government agents, and partner representatives.</p>
<p>· Strong organization and planning skills.</p>
<p>· Sufficient communication, rapport-building and listening skills that would enable effective engagement of all community members and families.</p>
<p>· Able to gather knowledge, organize information, and solve complicated problems.</p>
<p><b><i>Application Process </i></b></p>
<p>All interested applicants should submit a cover letter and resume by <b>April 15, 2022</b>.</p>
<p>Within the cover letter, please explain why you feel that you have the skills and abilities to effectively perform the activities described in this opportunity posting.</p>

Gaps in family genealogy, lost language, forgotten storytelling, and uncertainty around our own cultural values and traditions are but a few of the hardships Muskoday First Nation community members have endured. A major concern for our community is not knowing how many of our living or deceased community members attended residential school. Worse, is not knowing how many children from our community never came home.</p><p>To find these answers, Muskoday is embarking upon a new project titled: <i>Finding and Honouring Our Muskoday Children Lost at Residential Schools. </i>The project involves engagement of community to assess missing knowledge pieces, collection of residential school student records, proper capture of oral history, identifying the location of missing residential school children, developing a commemorative healing and reflection space for our residential school children, and supporting community members impacted by this project.</p><p><b><i>About the Opportunity</i></b></p><p>· The <i>Residential School Historian</i> is a part-time contract position designed to collect information that develops our understanding of the involvement of Muskoday children in residential schools throughout Saskatchewan and other provinces.</p><p>· The position holder will be required to engage community members in dialogue on their ancestors, children who attended residential school, and identify gaps in history caused by the experience.</p><p>· The position holder will collaborate with other First Nation communities who are also in the process of accessing student records, and work with these partners to determine the number and location of Muskoday children who attended residential school.</p><p>· Where missing Muskoday children are identified, the position holder will work to link families with the burial site and support them in determining an appropriate solution.</p><p>· Guided by community consultation, the position holder shall coordinate the planning and development of a memorial structure or space that commemorates Muskoday children who attended residential school.</p><p>· The position is a part-time contract, with the potential for renewal upon satisfactory service delivery.</p><p>· The opportunity is open to all individuals, regardless of ethnicity, race, gender or religion.</p><p><b><i>Required Qualifications</i></b></p><p>· Effective at engaging community members, government agents, and partner representatives.</p><p>· Strong organization and planning skills.</p><p>· Sufficient communication, rapport-building and listening skills that would enable effective engagement of all community members and families.</p><p>· Able to gather knowledge, organize information, and solve complicated problems.</p><p><b><i>Application Process </i></b></p><p>All interested applicants should submit a cover letter and resume by <b>April 15, 2022</b>.</p><p>Within the cover letter, please explain why you feel that you have the skills and abilities to effectively perform the activities described in this opportunity posting.</p><p>Job Type: Fixed term contract<br/>Contract length: 6 months</p><p>Schedule:</p><ul><li>Day shift</li><li>Monday to Friday</li></ul><p>COVID-19 considerations:<br/>Covid-19 Precautions in place.

<p><b>About us:</b>
</p><p>mCloud is unlocking the untapped potential of energy-intensive assets using IoT, AI, and the cloud. We operate three lines of business, connecting and optimizing assets like HVAC units in commercial buildings, wind turbines in renewable energy, and the control systems at process industry facilities. We're a global company, headquartered in Calgary with a presence across North America, the UK and continental Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and China.
</p><p>Today, we connect and manage over 59,000 energy assets through our AssetCare™ platform. We help our customers double asset productivity, reduce their asset energy consumption by up to 25%, and triple the speed at which they are able to respond to the unexpected. mCloud helps eliminate about 80,000 tons in greenhouse gas emissions every year – or the same amount of GHG emitted by 18,000 passenger cars on the road.
</p><p>Solving the world's most challenging energy problems is hard work – it takes dedicated, talented, and innovative people working together as one team to make it all happen. We are a team, which means ""we"" comes before ""me."" And we are driven to deliver measurable, bottom-line results for our customers everywhere through our technology. We get stuff done and we have fun doing it!

</p><p>If you want to be part of an elite team with the ambition to become Canada's next big unicorn tech company, mCloud is the place for you.

</p><p><b>Why you shouldn't join our team:</b>
</p><p>We are busy and fast-paced! We work hard. We are a global company, so our hours are not standard. Sometimes you have to be up early or work late to meet with people in different time zones, but with that comes flexibility.
</p><p>Our expectations are high. This is not an organization where you can hide or not constantly be driving for results.
</p><p>No day is ever the same, and most days, you come in with a list of things to do, and then something happens, and you need to pivot.
</p><p>We do not tolerate people who are only in it for themselves. We are a team, and we are all in the business of helping those around us succeed.

Colonial history unfolded in a way that saw Muskoday lose much of its own history. Gaps in family genealogy, lost language, forgotten storytelling, and uncertainty around our own cultural values and traditions are but a few of the hardships Muskoday First Nation community members have endured. A major concern for our community is not knowing how many of our living or deceased community members attended residential school. Worse, is not knowing how many children from our community never came home.</p><p>To find these answers, Muskoday is embarking upon a new project titled: <i>Finding and Honouring Our Muskoday Children Lost at Residential Schools. </i>The project involves engagement of community to assess missing knowledge pieces, collection of residential school student records, proper capture of oral history, identifying the location of missing residential school children, developing a commemorative healing and reflection space for our residential school children, and supporting community members impacted by this project.</p><p><b><i>About the Opportunity</i></b></p><p>· The <i>Residential School Historian</i> is a part-time contract position designed to collect information that develops our understanding of the involvement of Muskoday children in residential schools throughout Saskatchewan and other provinces.</p><p>· The position holder will be required to engage community members in dialogue on their ancestors, children who attended residential school, and identify gaps in history caused by the experience.</p><p>· The position holder will collaborate with other First Nation communities who are also in the process of accessing student records, and work with these partners to determine the number and location of Muskoday children who attended residential school.</p><p>· Where missing Muskoday children are identified, the position holder will work to link families with the burial site and support them in determining an appropriate solution.</p><p>· Guided by community consultation, the position holder shall coordinate the planning and development of a memorial structure or space that commemorates Muskoday children who attended residential school.</p><p>· The position is a part-time contract, with the potential for renewal upon satisfactory service delivery.</p><p>· The opportunity is open to all individuals, regardless of ethnicity, race, gender or religion.</p><p><b><i>Required Qualifications</i></b></p><p>· Effective at engaging community members, government agents, and partner representatives.</p><p>· Strong organization and planning skills.</p><p>· Sufficient communication, rapport-building and listening skills that would enable effective engagement of all community members and families.</p><p>· Able to gather knowledge, organize information, and solve complicated problems.</p><p><b><i>Application Process </i></b></p><p>All interested applicants should submit a cover letter and resume by <b>April 15, 2022</b>.</p><p>Within the cover letter, please explain why you feel that you have the skills and abilities to effectively perform the activities described in this opportunity posting.</p><p>Job Type: Fixed term contract<br/>Contract length: 6 months</p><p>Schedule:</p><ul><li>Day shift</li><li>Monday to Friday</li></ul><p>COVID-19 considerations:<br/>Covid-19 Precautions in place.

</p><p>History 204-World History, 1500-present (possible sections in Fall and Winter)
<br/>
This course introduces students to the broad contours of world history since 1500. Encounters and
<br/>
exchanges, as well as imperialism and state formation, are central themes. Students will also be
<br/>
introduced to the methods historians use to study the past and will consider Christian perspectives on
<br/>
the practices and understanding of history. The course will begin with European encounters with the
<br/>
Americas and conclude with an examination of 21st-century global challenges.<br/>
</p><p><br/>
History 361-Canada since 1867 (Fall only)
</p><p>This course seeks to introduce students to the main contours of Canadian history since Confederation
<br/>
in 1867. Particular attention is given to the patterns of interactions between Indigenous peoples and

European settlers. A variety of political, social, religious, racial, economic, and cultural themes will be
<br/>

Colonial history unfolded in a way that saw Muskoday lose much of its own history. Gaps in family genealogy, lost language, forgotten storytelling, and uncertainty around our own cultural values and traditions are but a few of the hardships Muskoday First Nation community members have endured. A major concern for our community is not knowing how many of our living or deceased community members attended residential school. Worse, is not knowing how many children from our community never came home.</p><p>To find these answers, Muskoday is embarking upon a new project titled: <i>Finding and Honouring Our Muskoday Children Lost at Residential Schools. </i>The project involves engagement of community to assess missing knowledge pieces, collection of residential school student records, proper capture of oral history, identifying the location of missing residential school children, developing a commemorative healing and reflection space for our residential school children, and supporting community members impacted by this project.</p><p><b><i>About the Opportunity</i></b></p><p>· The <i>Residential School Historian</i> is a part-time contract position designed to collect information that develops our understanding of the involvement of Muskoday children in residential schools throughout Saskatchewan and other provinces.</p><p>· The position holder will be required to engage community members in dialogue on their ancestors, children who attended residential school, and identify gaps in history caused by the experience.</p><p>· The position holder will collaborate with other First Nation communities who are also in the process of accessing student records, and work with these partners to determine the number and location of Muskoday children who attended residential school.</p><p>· Where missing Muskoday children are identified, the position holder will work to link families with the burial site and support them in determining an appropriate solution.</p><p>· Guided by community consultation, the position holder shall coordinate the planning and development of a memorial structure or space that commemorates Muskoday children who attended residential school.</p><p>· The position is a part-time contract, with the potential for renewal upon satisfactory service delivery.</p><p>· The opportunity is open to all individuals, regardless of ethnicity, race, gender or religion.</p><p><b><i>Required Qualifications</i></b></p><p>· Effective at engaging community members, government agents, and partner representatives.</p><p>· Strong organization and planning skills.</p><p>· Sufficient communication, rapport-building and listening skills that would enable effective engagement of all community members and families.</p><p>· Able to gather knowledge, organize information, and solve complicated problems.</p><p><b><i>Application Process </i></b></p><p>All interested applicants should submit a cover letter and resume by <b>April 15, 2022</b>.</p><p>Within the cover letter, please explain why you feel that you have the skills and abilities to effectively perform the activities described in this opportunity posting.</p><p>Job Type: Fixed term contract<br/>Contract length: 6 months</p><p>Schedule:</p><ul><li>Day shift</li><li>Monday to Friday</li></ul><p>COVID-19 considerations:<br/>Covid-19 Precautions in place.
